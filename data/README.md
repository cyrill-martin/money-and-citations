# Data
This repository contains the files of the StatDa term paper as part of my Certificate of Advanced Studies in Statistical Data Analysis & Data Visualization at the Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences.

The raw data on research grants were obtained from the [SNSF data portal](https://data.snf.ch/datasets) and are subject to the SNSF's [open data policy](https://data.snf.ch/about/open-data-policy).
