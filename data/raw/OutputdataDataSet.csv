Abstract Primary cilia are organelles necessary for proper implementation of developmental and homeostasis processes. To initiate their assembly, coordinated actions of multiple proteins are needed. Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a key player in the cilium assembly pathway, controlling final step of cilia initiation. The function of TTBK2 in ciliogenesisis critically dependent on its kinase activity, however, precise mechanism of action of this kinase is so far incompletely understood, in part due to very limited information about its relevant substrates. In this study we identify CEP83, CEP89, CCDC92, Rabin8 and DVL3 as substrates of TTBK2 kinase activity. Further, we characterise a set of phosphosites of the newly identified substrates and CEP164, induced by TTBK2 in vitro and in vivo and show that TTBK2 preferentially phosphorylates examined substrates at intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Intriguingly, we further show that identified TTBK2 phosphosites and consensus sequence delineated from those are distinct from motifs previously assigned to TTBK2. Finally, we address functional relevance of selected phosphorylations of CEP164 and provide evidence that the examined TTBK2-induced phosphorylations of CEP164 are relevant for the process of cilia formation. In summary, our work provides important insight into substrates-TTBK2 kinase relationship and suggests that multiple phosphorylation of IDRs is probably involved in the control of ciliogenesis in human cells.;Bernatik, Ondrej;PXD014199;2020-03-25T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD014199;PRIDE (Proteomics identifications database);Phosphorylation of multiple proteins involved in ciliogenesis by Tau Tubulin kinase 2;30D16BA8-6443-4445-B496-883AF6C256C4;166533
In Switzerland, the KESB authorities decide about welfare service delivery as well as about the taking of coercive measures. The authorities were created in 2013, following a change to the Swiss Civil Code (ZGB) adopted by the Swiss Parliament. Whereas most of the French-speaking cantons were able to continue working within the existing system, the changes to the Civil Code led to organizational changes in the German-speaking cantons and the Ticino.Our analysis will begin in the 1990s, when the first meetings on the reform of the guardianship system, as child and adult protection services were referred to back then, took place. We will then track the reform on the national level as well as its implementation on the cantonal level at the turn of the millennium. This will be followed by an analysis of the debate in the media and its implications for today.;"Kuenzler, Johanna; Stauffer, Bettina";https://doi.org/10.23662/FORS-DS-1271-1;;https://www.swissubase.ch/en/catalogue/studies/14075/17080/datasets/1271/2064/overview;SwissUBase;Narratives from the Discourse on the Swiss Child and Adult Protection Policy (CAPP) between 2013 and 2016 [Dataset];1DFB0419-911D-4D0A-B0B6-01F1E6A5220B;177405

Friday 16th October 2020, 5.30pm (CET time) - Online, Duke NT colloquia. This lecture presents the Swiss National Science Foundation MARK16 project (2018-2023), with its first results and its virtual research environment, https://mark16.sib.swiss. Secondly, it will summarize the main results of a forthcoming ZNT 2021 article about the Latin Codex Bobiensis, or Codex k, or VL 1, or G.VII.15. Of ambiguous reputation, this manuscript ends Mark with a shorter ending slightly different from the Greek one, with a puzzling expression et qui cum puero erant - “and those who were with the boy”. The MARK16 project has chosen to transcribe this expression by et qui cum puero erant, whereas its editing presents et qui cum Petro erant, as the lecture will argue. Last but not least, the enquiry highlights an alternative tradition, present in some versions of the shorter ending: Peter’s companions - and not the women - are reporting briefly instructions before the final apparition of Jesus himself. This finding fosters further the inquiry about Mark endings, by drawing the scholarly attention to VL 1, a manuscript contemporaneous of GA 01 and GA 03.;Clivaz, Claire;https://doi.org/11280/dc8c7c4f;2020-10-21T00:00:00Z;https://nakala.fr/11280/dc8c7c4f;Nakala;"New elements on Mark's shorter ending in Codex Bobbiensis and beyond ";628D6319-4A7A-4427-B608-E4C886D2E590;179755

"The Mathematica notebook can calculate frequencies, dissipation dilution factors and intrinsic loss-limited quality factors of symmetrically-branching out-of-plane flexural modes of stressed binary tree resonators. In addition it can be used for the visualization of modes and for the calculation of boundary and distributed loss coefficients.Throughout the code it is assumed that the tree resonators are composed of high aspect-ratio beams with rectangular cross section, fixed thickness and width which depends of the branching level.

Since the global food crisis of 2008, Senegalese migrant associations have become involved in the agricultural development of their localities of origin, and through their projects they have created a transnational dynamic characterised by the circulation of goods, innovations and skills between the host and the origin areas. In this book, attention is focused on the analysis of a series of associative projects initiated by Senegalese migrants in three European countries, France, Switzerland and Italy. These countries differ in terms of policies aimed at supporting and recognising migrant and diaspora associations in their role as actors of cooperation. The comparison is significant in order to understand whether the factors specific to each host context have an impact on the associative dynamics and on the characteristics of the projects in terms of sustainable agricultural development. Such an analysis is also useful for other host and home countries. It consents to put forward considerations that aim to enrich the current debate on the links between migration and development, which is taking place from the global to the local level among researchers, international organisations, state actors, NGOs, as well as migrant and diaspora associations.;"Maggi, Jenny; Sarr, Dame";10.33058/seismo.20746;2021-12-10T00:00:00Z;https://www.seismoverlag.ch/fr/daten/associations-de-migrants-et-cooperation-internationale/;seismo verlag;Associations de migrants et coopération internationale.

In the past fifty years, port cities around the world have experienced considerable changes to their morphologies and their identities. The increasing intensification of global networks and logistics, and the resulting pressure on human societies and earthly environments have been characteristic of the rise of a »planetary age«. This volume argues that contemporary artistic practices and critical poetics trace an alternate construction of the imaginaries and aspirations of our present societies at the crossroads of sea and land - taking into account complex pasts and interconnected histories, transnational flux, as well as material and immaterial borders.;"Gee, Gabriel Neil; Wiedmer, Caroline";https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839450239;2021-05-04T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839450239;Transcript;DOI;B8732E6D-34AE-433C-BA8F-4D23A2E889FE;198044

Intitulée « TROISIÈME TESTAMENT » ET NOUVELLE ÉVANGÉLISATION. L’autobiographie comme composante analogique de la Révélation. De l’hypothèse d’une théologie autobiographique à une pastorale autobiographique d’évangélisation, et composée de sept chapitres pour une longueur d’environ 800 pages, la thèse de Massimiliano Scalici est destinée à un public varié du fait du sujet envisagé, à savoir l’autobiographie. Bien qu’exploré foncièrement sous l’angle théologique, ce thème suscite l’intérêt de diverses disciplines humaines. De fait, ce travail est entièrement traversé par une approche interdisciplinaire impliquant d’autres domaines scientifiques à côté de la théologie, notamment la narratologie, les théories autobiographiques (P. Lejeune, G. Gusdorf, D. Demetrio), la rhétorique (U. Eco), la philosophie du récit (P. Ricœur) et la pédagogie concernant l’éducation des adultes (andragogie). Au long de la phase dogmatique de la recherche se déployant dans la première et la deuxième partie, le débat théologique sur la dimension narrative de la Révélation divine s’enrichit des apports de théologiens importants, tels H.-U. von Balthasar, E. Jüngel, J. Ratzinger, Y. Congar et C. Theobald. À l’intérieur de la thèse, un précieux chapitre est consacré entièrement à une analyse du Petit Prince d’Antoine de Saint-Exupéry menée sur un registre autobiographique à proprement parler, et appliquant, de manière originale, les trois mimèsis de la philosophie du récit de P. Ricœur. Enfin, dans la troisième partie, constituant le moment pastoral de la recherche, l’auteur envisage le thème de l’évangélisation. Ici, avant de déboucher sur la proposition du « Cénacle autobiographique », il reporte, telle une petite « autobiographie intellectuelle », l’interview d’A. Binz, un ancien professeur suisse de théologie pastorale et de pédagogie religieuse des adultes, et pionnier en Europe de l’approche autobiographique en pastorale. Couronnement pragmatique de sa recherche-action, les « cénacles » ou cercles autobiographiques attestent l’expérience de Massimiliano Scalici avec des personnes adultes appartenant à trois milieux sociaux et ecclésiaux différents : fidèles d’une paroisse, agents pastoraux engagés dans la Caritas d’un diocèse et personnes détenues. Les ateliers autobiographiques, rapportés au dernier chapitre, témoignent de l’implication marquante des « cenacolisti » (les participants aux cercles autobiographiques) et des avantages formatifs, thérapeutiques et performatifs dégagés par la méthode autobiographique relativement à l’aspect anthropologique et pédagogique de la foi chrétienne et de l’annonce. Car, finalement, à l’intérieur de ces cénacles, jouant sur les langages autobiographiques et synesthésiques, l’unique Évangile que le Seigneur, en plus de le confier aux apôtres et aux évangélistes, a inscrit également dans les cœurs mêmes des hommes, jaillit sous un autre mode, proprement le mode analogique qu’est le « troisième Testament ».;Scalici, Massimiliano;10.24894/978-3-7965-4357-9;2021-05-08T00:00:00Z;https://www.schwabeonline.ch;Schwabe eLibrary;Données output du subside 10BP12_202528: « Troisième testament et nouvelle évangelisation ».

RNA-binding proteins are instrumental for post-transcriptional gene regulation, controlling all aspects throughout the lifecycle of RNA molecules. However, transcriptome-wide methods to profile RNA-protein interactions in vivo remain technically challenging and require large amounts of starting material. Herein, we present an improved library preparation strategy for crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) that is based on tailing and ligation of cDNA molecules (TLC). TLC involves the generation of solid-phase cDNA, followed by ribotailing to increase the efficiency of subsequent adapter ligation. These modifications result in a streamlined, fully bead-based library preparation strategy, which eliminates time-consuming purification procedures and drastically reduces sample loss, allowing the profiling of RNA-protein interactions from as few as 1000 cells.In the accompanying manuscript, we have applied TLC-CLIP to four endogenous RNA-binding proteins, demonstrating its reproducibility and improved precision due to a higher number of crosslinking-induced deletions that serve as an intrinsic quality metric and increase both specificity and nucleotide-resolution.;Ernst, Christina;dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.rm7vzywr4lx1/v1;2023-05-10T00:00:00Z;http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.rm7vzywr4lx1/v1;protocols.io;TLC-CLIP Protocol;76E9E575-629F-4535-B6A4-158546196EB1;202048
The Late Jurassic ‘Solnhofen Limestones’ are famous for their exceptionally preserved fossils, including the urvogel Archaeopteryx, which has played a pivotal role in the discussion of bird origins. Here we describe a new, non-archaeopterygid avialan from the Lower Tithonian Mörnsheim Formation of the Solnhofen Archipelago, Alcmonavis poeschli gen. et sp. nov. Represented by a right wing, Alcmonavis shows several derived characters, including a pronounced attachment for the pectoralis muscle, a pronounced tuberculum bicipitale radii, and a robust second manual digit, indicating that it is a more derived avialan than Archaeopteryx. Several modifications, especially in muscle attachments of muscles that in modern birds are related to the downstroke of the wing, indicate an increased adaptation of the forelimb for active flapping flight in the early evolution of birds. This discovery indicates higher avialan diversity in the Late Jurassic than previously recognized.;"Foth, Christian; Rauhut, Oliver WM; Tischlinger, Helmut";https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43789.027;2019-05-14T00:00:00Z;https://elifesciences.org/articles/43789/figures#files;eLife;A non-archaeopterygid avialan theropod from the Late Jurassic of southern Germany;873B6179-9339-4832-8EA0-EC14E1D6D8BC;174040
La position particulière de l’art vidéo - inscrit dans l’art, partageant une mêmetechnique avec d’autres domaines, tout en reposant sur des spécificités fortes,contemporain mais déjà dépassé - en fait un terrain idéal pour ausculter la narrationde l’art, et plus largement sa construction sociale. Ce livre propose de considérerles catalogues et les affiches d’exposition, les articles, les dépliants, les documentsde travail ou encore la correspondance comme moteurs de la formation d’un art.Usant d’un appareil conceptuel alliant sociologie de la connaissance, sociologiede l’art et histoire de l’art, il s’arrête sur les deux premières expositions muséalesd’art vidéo en France et en Suisse afin d’en fournir la première étude approfondie.Les discours que ces manifestations ont produits font l’objet d’une lecture rapprochéeafin de faire ressortir les termes employés, les champs lexicaux formés, lesstratégies discursives élaborées pour expliquer et justifier la tenue d’une expositionde vidéos dans un musée municipal. Dans un second temps, le propos abordeles contextes de production de ces discours et le rôle joué par les institutions etles auteur-e-s impliqué-e-s dans chaque exposition. La mise en commun d’uneanalyse de texte et d’une étude de contexte permet de dégager les modalités deconstruction discursive de l’art vidéo en tant que catégorie de l’art contemporain.La (re)découverte de textes sources des années 1970 permet en outre de préciseret compléter l’histoire de l’art contemporain.;Rérat, Melissa;10.3726/b19624;2022-07-01T00:00:00Z;https://libra.unine.ch/Publications/Personne/R/Melissa_RErat/43897;Libra, Université de Neuchâtel;Les mots de la vidéo;BE81659B-CA53-4277-B918-36BFA13D8BA8;208435

Plato's Timaeus brings together a number of studies from both leading Plato specialists and up-and-coming researchers from across Europe. The contributions cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from the literary form of the work to the ontology of sense perception and the status of medicine in Timaeus' account. Although informed by a commitment to methodological diversity, the collection as a whole forms an organic unity, opening fresh perspectives on widely read passages, while shedding new light on less frequently discussed topics. The volume thus provides a valuable resource for students and researchers at all levels, whether their interest bears on the Timaeus as a whole or on a particular passage.;"Jorgenson, Chad; Karfík, Filip; Špinka, Štěpán";10.1163/9789004437081;2021-01-01T00:00:00Z;https://brill.com/view/title/57430;brill.com;Plato’s Timaeus;0B82ECBF-9601-4DD6-B03A-C0DD10AF8605;198567
L’Hispanic Society of America conserve dans ses souterrains un exemplaire manuscrit daté de 1621 qui, pour une raison inconnue, ne fut jamais imprimé. Il s’agit de l’Historia del Huérfano, por Andrés de León, un livre qui narre à la troisième personne les aventures (et mésaventures) d’un jeune homme désigné comme « l’Orphelin ». Né en Espagne, le personnage voyage en Amérique à l’âge de quatorze ans. Il y prend l’habit religieux dans un couvent augustin, mais une série de péripéties l’oblige à voyager (parfois sous le déguisement d’un soldat) à travers une grande partie des territoires appartenant à la couronne espagnole, tant en Amérique qu’en Europe. Le texte, qui s’étend sur 328 folios, est accompagné de plus de septante poèmes que l’Orphelin aurait écrits de sa main, offrant un témoignage sans précédent de l’effervescence de l’activité poétique dans les colonies hispaniques. Or, malgré son importance, l’œuvre demeurait méconnue des chercheurs (et du grand public) et des questions importantes, telles que l’attribution du manuscrit et le genre du texte, restaient encore à élucider. Ce volume propose une édition critique du texte, dotée d’un appareil de notes rigoureux qui rend compte de toutes les informations (notamment de type linguistique ou historique) qui pourraient éclairer le lecteur contemporain. Cette édition est accompagnée d’une étude préliminaire où nous avons confirmé les hypothèses lancées par de précédents chercheurs quant à l’identité de l’auteur, qui s’avère être bel et bien Martín de León y Cárdenas, frère augustin espagnol. Elle recueille aussi un grand nombre de cas d’intertextualités et de prêts entre notre manuscrit et d’autres œuvres de l’époque (indiqués également dans l’édition sous forme de notes).

Significant increases in sedimentation rate accompany the evolution of multicellularity. These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits which control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves, are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean Sphaeroforma genus - close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages - we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least two distinct physical mechanisms. We first find a dramatic >300x variation in sedimentation rate for different Sphaeroforma species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained fast settling S. arctica isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal “clumping” multicellular variants with increased size and density. Additionally, density increases arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in four additional species from the Sphaeroforma genus, suggesting variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By sequencing evolved isolates, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodelling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the evolution of multicellularity.;"Dudin, Omaya; New, Aaron M; Ruiz-Trillo, Iñaki; Wielgoss, Sébastien";doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453070;2021-07-23T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453070;BioRxiv;Regulation of sedimentation rate shapes the evolution of multicellularity in a unicellular relative of animals;3912A91F-61C7-4F9D-8DE6-EA0FD8C26653;185859

Ecritures digitales aims to demonstrate how digital writing contributes to the emergence of “a new relationship between the human body and the machine” as Jacques Derrida proposed when he considered the effects of new technologies. This reconfigured relationship, not surprisingly, is also influencing the digital future of the Jewish-Christian textual corpus referred to as “the Scriptures”. The French title brings together this duality in one expression: Ecritures digitales. The English subtitle makes explicit the double meaning of the unique French word Ecritures: Digital writing, digital Scriptures. With a full French version and an abbreviated English version, this monograph analyzes the main challenges and opportunities for both writing and the Scriptures in the transition to digital culture. Ecritures digitales souhaite démontrer de quelle manière l’écriture digitale contribue à l’émergence d’une « nouvelle relation du corps humain aux machines », selon le diagnostique posé par Jacques Derrida à propos des effets des nouvelles technologies. Cette relation innovante influence également l’avenir numérique du corpus textuel judéo-chrétien désigné comme «les Ecritures». Le titre français rassemble en une seule expression ces deux thématiques: Ecritures digitales. Le sous-titre anglais rend sa double signification explicite: Digital writing, digital Scriptures.

Ce livre met en exergue ce qui se loge dans l’ombre du geste dansant à partir d’une ethnographie des processus de création de trois compagnies suisses : Nicole Seiler, Massimo Furlan/Numéro23Prod, deRothfils. L’anthropologue s’est intéressée au processus de fabrication d’oeuvres chorégraphiques qui abordent des questions existentielles. Angoisse, solitude, rapports entre morts et vivants, ces performances mettent en scène des ombres sous la forme d’esprits, de fantômes et de monstres. Enrichie par une pratique personnelle de la danse, cette recherche est née d’une anthropologie phénoménologique. La proximité avec les danseur.euse.s et chorégraphes a introduit la chercheuse au coeur des préoccupations de la création chorégraphique, et l’a amenée à partager les joies et les douleurs des corps affectés. En dialogue avec les études en danse, cet ouvrage contribue aux théories sociales du corps et des sensations.;Vionnet, Claire;ISBN	9782825712740;2022-02-15T00:00:00Z;https://www.georg.ch/l-ombre-du-geste;Georg éditeur;L'Ombre du geste;622A30A9-51FE-4BB4-9336-2D36B15EF699;205258

AbstractHuman observers can accurately estimate statistical summaries from an ensemble of multiple stimuli, including the average size, hue, and direction of motion. The efficiency and speed with which statistical summaries are extracted suggest an automatic mechanism of ensemble coding that operates beyond the capacity limits of attention and memory. However, the extent to which ensemble coding reflects a truly parallel and holistic mode of processing or a non-uniform and biased integration of multiple items is still under debate. In the present work, we used a technique, based on a Spatial Weighted Average Model (SWM), to recover the spatial profile of weights with which individual stimuli contribute to the estimated average during mean size adjustment tasks. In a series of experiments, we derived two-dimensional SWM maps for ensembles presented at different retinal locations, with different degrees of dispersion and under different attentional demands. Our findings revealed strong spatial anisotropies and leftward biases in ensemble coding that were organized in retinotopic reference frames and persisted under attentional manipulations. These results demonstrate an anisotropic spatial contribution to ensemble coding that could be mediated by the differential activation of the two hemispheres during spatial processing and scene encoding.;"Pascucci, David; Plomp, Gijs; Ruethemann, Nadia";https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87620-1;2021-12-15T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/4771901#.YKdkuKgzaUk;zenodo;The anisotropic field of ensemble coding;D15E41E8-CC64-4643-98D3-F0C6B0F45FC2;179988

Many seasonally stratified lakes accumulate substantial amounts of the greenhouse gas methane in the anoxic zone. Methane oxidizing bacteria in the water column act as a converter, oxidizing methane into carbon dioxide and biomass before it reaches the atmosphere. Current observations and estimates of this methane oxidation efficiency are diverging, especially for the lake overturn period. Here we combine a model of turbulent mixing, gas exchange and microbial growth with a comprehensive data set for autumn mixing to quantify the relevant physical and microbial processes. We show that the microbial methane converter is effectively transforming the increased methane flux during the overturn period. Only rare events of pronounced surface cooling in combination with persistently strong wind can trigger substantial outgassing. In the context of climate change, these results suggest that changes in the frequency of storms may be even more important for methane emissions from temperate lakes than gradual warming.;Zimmermann, Matthias;" DOI: 10.3929/ethz-b-000350091";2019-09-27T00:00:00Z;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/350091;Research Collection ETHZ;Lake overturn as a key driver for methane oxidation;A1F685E3-D0F8-452A-9719-1AFE4FDAA819;156759

Die Serie anspruchsvoller nationaler, internationaler und universaler Ausstellungen trug zur Gestaltung der Klangkulissen der Hauptstädte Europas, Amerikas, Japans und sogar Australiens bei. Wir zeigen hier Ergebnisse über die Klangwelt in einigen dieser Ereignisse: Exposition universelle (Paris, 1889), Internationale Musik- und Theaterwesen Ausstellung (Wien, 1892), Exposición Histórico-America (Madrid, 1892), Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893), Esposizione Italo Americana (Genoa, 1892), Esposizione Emiliana (Bologna, 1888), Esposizione Nazionale (Palermo, 1891-1892).The set of Great Exhibitions, World Fairs, and Universal Exhibitions modelled the soundscape of the main capitals in Europe, America, and - later - Australia. Here, we display some of our research results about the sonic and musical aspects of some of these events: Exposition universelle (Paris, 1889), Internationale Musik- und Theaterwesen Ausstellung (Wien, 1892), Exposición Histórico-America (Madrid, 1892), Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893), Esposizione Italo Americana (Genoa, 1892), Esposizione Emiliana (Bologna, 1888), Esposizione Nazionale (Palermo, 1891-1892).;"Cáceres-Piñuel, María; Napoli, Alberto; Strumbl, Melanie; Urchueguía, Cristina";http://janacek.unibe.ch/nachtderforschung/;2018-08-13T00:00:00Z;https://still processing;BORIS/;Der Globale Soundtrack vor 100 Jahren / Pictures, Music, and Sound of World Exhibitions in the 19th Century;9813E813-6DA2-4ACA-B4A1-7AC8B5B4A64B;159817

We obtained time-series of OCT scans reporting the structural development of phototrophic benthic biofilms in a open-channel flume experiment in raw lake water. Growth conditions and materials are reported in the relative publication. OCT scans at two lateral resolutions (40 um, 40 um, 2.18 um x,y,z respectivey) and (11.1 um ,11.1 um and 2.18 um) were taken every 3 days in a 15 days experiment. 66 x 3 low resolution (LR) scans covered an area of 0.4 m x 0.025 m in a tiled pattern. 3 x 3 high resolution (HR) scans were taken at the extremes of the same area of interest. These are labeled as slow-flow morphotype (SFM, or B5) and and fast-flow morphotype (FFM, or B1), to indicate the respective contrasting flow velocity conditions. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Authomated OCT scans acquisition was done with the system descibed in (Depetris et al. 2019, Automated 3D Optical Coherence Tomography to Elucidate Biofilm Morphogenesis Over Large Spatial Scales, JoVE, 10.3791/59356).

Nanoparticles are detected as spots based on the fluorescence signal above the threshold and their size using Imaris’ built-in spots detector. Bigger spots were fit with multiple nanoparticles based on the size.Surfaces are detected using Imaris’ built-in surface detector.Cell bodies are detected using Imaris’ built-in surface detector­­­­­.For each detected surface, a Euclidean distance map is computed. In the distance map, each pixel contains its distance to the nearest surface edge. Then, the average distance to the surface edge for each spot by measuring the mean intensity around the spot in the Euclidean distance map was computed. Negative values represent objects inside the surface and positive values outside the surface. Nanoparticle agglomerates were fitted with several nanoparticles based on the nanoparticle size.;"Burri, Oliver; Klok, Harm-Anton; Seitz, Arne; Thomsen, Tanja";10.5281/zenodo.3999184;2020-08-25T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3999185#.X22S0u2xUuV;Zenodo;Imaris EasyXT Particle Distance Analysis (Matlab);9E0BF588-B132-4D94-8933-6A3B10504DAA;175898
"The book examines the private palaces in the Duchy of Milan during the Sforza era, designed and built between Ludovico il Moro's seizure of power in 1480 and the first quarter of the following century. The result is a catalogue of examples that are essential for understanding the development of the typology and the emergence of a new housing model capable of including, among its functions, that of representing, by fixing it in a building, the social, political and cultural role of the client.Extensive chapters are devoted to the individual palazzi, which we can recognise - in the famous expression of Pietro Aretino - as ""modernly ancient and antiquely modern"". These chapters analyse them from various perspectives and lead to the identification of an innovative line in Lombard art, not only through examples in Milan, but also by means of precise verifications in Pavia, Piacenza, Lodi, Cremona, Crema and Vigevano, in parallel with what was happening in Florence or Venice, in Mantua or Ferrara and finally, at a slightly later date, in Rome.Through the analysis of the general advancement of architectural culture as a whole and of the interconnections between building sites, craftsmen and linguistic inventions, the range of architectures considered widens considerably to include some crucial religious buildings and, subsequently, several Roman palaces, where the descent of the ""Lombards"" - from Bramante from Urbino, by then integrated in Milanese cultural circles, to Bramantino and Cristoforo Solari - paved the way for decisive and critically inescapable exchanges.";MARTINIS, ROBERTA;9788822911636;2021-02-27T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/4568981#.YDybhJM2qit;Zenodo;Anticamente moderni.

Des collections coloniales sont-elles conservées dans les réserves des musées suisses ? L’étude de la provenance de fonds anciens d’ethnographie et d’histoire naturelle, conservées dans les institutions patrimoniales suisses et collectées dès le XVIIe siècle, met en évidence que ces derniers ont pour la plupart été rassemblés en contextes coloniaux.La particularité géopolitique du pays a souvent engendré l’éviction de ces ensembles des études portant sur ceux d’origine impériale, royale ou princière en Europe. Ce livre critique, issu de l'étude matérielle d'objets et de spécimens naturels croisée à celle d'archives et d'images, pour l'essentiel inédites, est le premier du genre pour ce territoire et à cette époque. Il apporte alors des éléments nouveaux sur l'histoire des collections non européennes à l'échelle de la Suisse. Il inscrit aussi cette histoire dans les questionnements actuels sur l'avenir de ces artificialia et des ces naturalia : restitution, co-documentation et co-responsabilité.;Brizon, Claire;978-2-88351-117-0;2023-03-15T00:00:00Z;https://www.seismoverlag.ch/fr/daten/collections-coloniales/;seismoverlag;Collections coloniales.

The performance of machine learning algorithms used for the segmentation of 3D biomedical images lags behind that of the algorithms employed in the classification of 2D photos. This may be explained by the comparative lack of high-volume, high-quality training datasets, which require state-of-the art imaging facilities, domain experts for annotation and large computational and personal resources to create. The HR-Kidney dataset presented in this work bridges this gap by providing 1.7 TB of artefact-corrected synchrotron radiation-based X-ray phase-contrast microtomography images of whole mouse kidneys and validated segmentations of 33 729 glomeruli, which represents a 1-2 orders of magnitude increase over currently available biomedical datasets. The dataset further contains the underlying raw data, classical segmentations of renal vasculature and uriniferous tubules, as well as true 3D manual annotations. By removing limits currently imposed by small training datasets, the provided data open up the possibility for disruptions in machine learning for biomedical image analysis.;"Hieber, Simone; Kuo, Willy; Kurtcuoglu, Vartan; Müller, Bert; Rossinelli, Diego; Schulz, Georg; Wenger, Roland";https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2108.02226;2021-08-04T00:00:00Z;https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02226;arXiv;Terabyte-scale supervised 3D training and benchmarking dataset of the mouse kidney;2ADE5044-76E2-4408-B226-E958F42632BD;153523

We considered the household income data of the Structural Survey of Homes of Galicia (SSHG) which contains many potentially correlated covariates. We obtained this data set from the Galician Institute of Statistics. The SSHG contains data on 23 628 individuals within 9 203 households which were collected in 2014 and published in 2015. It comprises information about the total income as well as different characteristics on individual and household level. The variable of interest is the monthly household income. This variable was obtained by taking the twelfth of the total yearly income which consists of paid work, own professional activity and miscellaneous benefits. We considered following covariates: age, education level, type of household, and variables indicating financial difficulties of the household at the end of a month.

Climate trends in the Antarctic region remain poorly characterized, owing to the brevity and scarcity of direct climate observations and the large magnitude of interannual to decadal-scale climate variability. Here, within the framework of the PAGES Antarctica2k working group, we build an enlarged database of ice core water stable isotope records from Antarctica, consisting of 112 records. We produce both unweighted and weighted isotopic (d18O) composites and temperature reconstructions since 0 CE, binned at 5- and 10-year resolution, for seven climatically distinct regions covering the Antarctic continent. Following earlier work of the Antarctica2k working group, we also produce composites and reconstructions for the broader regions of East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the whole continent. We use three methods for our temperature reconstructions: (i) a temperature scaling based on the d18O-temperature relationship output from an ECHAM5-wiso model simulation nudged to ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalyses from 1979 to 2013, and adjusted for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet region to borehole temperature data, (ii) a temperature scaling of the isotopic normalized anomalies to the variance of the regional reanalysis temperature and (iii) a composite-plus-scaling approach used in a previous continent-scale reconstruction of Antarctic temperature since 1 CE but applied to the new Antarctic ice core database. Our new reconstructions confirm a significant cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE across all Antarctic regions where records extend back into the 1st millennium, with the exception of the Wilkes Land coast and Weddell Sea coast regions. Within this long-term cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE, we find that the warmest period occurs between 300 and 1000 CE, and the coldest interval occurs from 1200 to 1900 CE. Since 1900 CE, significant warming trends are identified for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Dronning Maud Land coast and the Antarctic Peninsula regions, and these trends are robust across the distribution of records that contribute to the unweighted isotopic composites and also significant in the weighted temperature reconstructions. Only for the Antarctic Peninsula is this most recent century-scale trend unusual in the context of natural variability over the last 2000 years. However, projected warming of the Antarctic continent during the 21st century may soon see significant and unusual warming develop across other parts of the Antarctic continent. The extended Antarctica2k ice core isotope database developed by this working group opens up many avenues for developing a deeper understanding of the response of Antarctic climate to natural and anthropogenic climate forcings. The first long-term quantification of regional climate in Antarctica presented herein is a basis for data-model comparison and assessments of past, present and future driving factors of Antarctic climate.;"Neukom, Raphael; Stenni, Barbara";https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/22589;2017-12-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/22589;NOAA paleoclimate database;PAGES Antarctica2k Temperature Reconstructions;EE6AD03D-4674-4BCE-81A4-1DEBB60F3509;154802

The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the earth's dominant mode of inter-annual climate variability. It alternates between warm (El Nino) and cold (La Nina) states, with global impacts on climate and society. This study provides new ENSO reconstructions based on a large, updated collection of proxy records. We use a novel reconstruction approach that employs running principal components, which allows us to take covariance changes between proxy records into account and thereby identify periods of likely teleconnection changes. Using different implementations of the principal component analysis enables us to identify periods within the last millennium when quantifications of ENSO are most robust. These periods range from 1580 to the end of the 17th century and from 1825 to present. We incorporate an assessment of consistency among our new and existing ENSO reconstructions leading to five short phases of low agreement among the reconstructions between 1700 and 1786. We find a consistent spatial pattern of proxy covariance during these four phases, differing from the structure seen over the instrumental period. This pattern points towards changes in teleconnections in the west Pacific/Australasian region, compared to the present state. Using our new reconstructions, we find a significant response of ENSO towards more La Nina-like conditions 3-5 years after major volcanic events. We further show that our new reconstructions and existing reconstructions largely agree on the state of ENSO during volcanic eruptions in the years 1695 and 1784, which helps put into perspective the climatic response to these events. During all other large volcanic eruptions of the last 1000 years, there is no reconstruction coherency with regard to the state of ENSO.;"Dätwler, Christoph; Neukom, Raphael";https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/25891;2019-04-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/25891;NOAA paleoclimate database;Multiproxy El Nino-Southern Oscillation 1,000 Year Reconstructions;D06EF10F-5F40-4BD3-B00D-1A9A48D8C610;154802
In contrast to the vast majority of reptiles, the skulls of adult crown birds are characterized by a high degree of integration due to bone fusion, e.g., an ontogenetic event generating a net reduction in the number of bones. To understand this process in an evolutionary context, we investigate postnatal ontogenetic changes in the skulls of crown bird and non-avian theropods using anatomical network analysis (AnNA). Due to the greater number of bones and bone contacts, early juvenile crown birds have less integrated skulls, resembling their non-avian theropod ancestors, including Archaeopteryx lithographica and Ichthyornis dispars. Phylogenetic comparisons indicate that skull bone fusion and the resulting modular integration represent a peramorphosis (developmental exaggeration of the ancestral adult trait) that evolved late during avialan evolution, at the origin of crown-birds. Succeeding the general paedomorphic shape trend, the occurrence of an additional peramorphosis reflects the mosaic complexity of the avian skull evolution.;"Foth, Christian; Plateau, Olivia";10.1038/s42003-020-0914-4;2020-12-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-0914-4#Sec11;Communications Biology;Birds have peramorphic skulls, too: anatomical network analyses reveal oppositional heterochronies in avian skull evolution;10458761-5CFE-49B8-BC13-1096E3D43385;174040
"Adaptive radiations have played a major role in generating modern and deep-time biodiversity. The Triassic radiation of the Archosauromorpha was one of the most spectacular vertebrate radiations, giving rise to many highly ecomorphologically varied lineages - including the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and stem-crocodylians - that dominated the larger-bodied land fauna for the following 150 Ma, and ultimately gave rise to today’s >10,000 species of birds and crocodylians. This radiation provides an outstanding testbed for hypotheses relating to adaptive radiations more broadly. Recent studies have started to characterize the tempo and mode of the archosauromorph early adaptive radiation, indicating very high initial rates of evolution, non-competitive niche-filling processes, and previously unrecognized morphological disparity even among non-crown taxa. However, these analyses rested primarily either on discrete characters or on geometric morphometrics of the cranium only, or even failed to fully include phylogenetic information. Here we expand previous 2D geometric morphometric cranial datasets to include new taxa and reconstructions, and create an analogous dataset of the pelvis, thereby allowing comparison of anatomical regions and the transition from “sprawling” to “upright” posture to be examined. We estimated morphological disparity and evolutionary rates through time. All sampled clades showed a delayed disparity peak for sum of variances and average nearest neighbour distances in both the cranium and pelvis, with disparity likely not saturated by the end of the studied time span (Late Jurassic); this contrasts with smaller radiations, but lends weight to similar results for large, ecomorphologically-varied groups. We find lower variations in pelvic than cranial disparity among Triassic-Jurassic archosaurs, which may be related to greater morphofunctional constraints on the pelvis. Contrasting with some previous work, but also confirming some previous findings during adaptive radiations, we find relatively widespread evidence of correlation between sampled diversity and disparity, especially at the largest phylogenetic scales and using average displacement rather than sum of variances as disparity metric; this also demonstrates the importance of comparing disparity metrics, and the importance of phylogenetic scale. Stem and crown archosauromorphs show a morphological diversification of both the cranium and pelvis with higher initial rates (Permian-Middle Triassic and at the base of major clades) followed by lower rates once diversification into niches has occurred (Late Triassic-Jurassic), indicating an “early burst” pattern sensu lato. Our results provide a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the early archosauromorph radiation and have significant bearing on the understanding of deep-time adaptive radiations more broadly, indicating widespread patterns of delayed disparity peaks, initial correlation of diversity and disparity, and evolutionary early bursts.";"Ezcurra, Martín; Foth, Christian; Sookias, Roland";10.5281/zenodo.5175797;2021-08-10T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/5175797;Zenodo;Rapid initial morphospace expansion and delayed morphological disparity peak in the first 100 million years of the archosauromorph evolutionary radiation;752FA6A8-F141-4969-A6DD-3CDF983016FB;174040
The data stems from the three burst conducted between September 2018 and September 2019. During five days (Monday - Friday), participants were asked about their emotional well-being, their whereabouts, and their social interactions three times a day (at 9am, at 2.30 pm, and at 9pm). At 9pm they were also asked about their well-being on different dimensions (social, emotional, cognitive). During the measurement, they wore a the so-called media watch. This watch recorded their radio and their television use automatically. These automatically recorded data were condensed into minutes right before each time the questionnaire was triggered (at 9am, at 2.30 pm, and at 9pm).;Hofer, Matthias;"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/U84FP ";2020-02-03T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/;osf.io;MUAWO Burst 1 - Burst 3 (including baseline data);0F2D0C01-705D-4BC7-B3D2-D048E5F30C25;174085

The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric interannual variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extra-tropics. Here, we assess the stationarity of SAM spatial correlations with instrumental and paleoclimate proxy data for the past millennium. The instrumental period shows that temporal non-stationarities in SAM teleconnections are not consistent across the SH land areas. This suggests that the influence of the SAM index is modulated by regional effects. However, within key-regions with good proxy data coverage (South America, Tasmania, New Zealand), teleconnections are mostly stationary over the instrumental period. Using different stationarity criteria for proxy record selection, we provide new austral summer and annual mean SAM index reconstructions over the last millennium. Our summer SAM reconstructions are very robust to changes in proxy record selection and the selection of the calibration period, particularly on the multi-decadal timescale. In contrast, the weaker performance and lower agreement in the annual mean SAM reconstructions point towards changing teleconnection patterns that may be particularly important outside the summer months. Our results clearly portend that the temporal stationarity of the proxy-climate relationships should be taken into account in the design of comprehensive regional and hemispherical climate reconstructions. The summer SAM reconstructions show no significant relationship to solar, greenhouse gas and volcanic forcing, with the exception of an extremely strong negative anomaly following the AD 1257 Samalas eruption. Furthermore, reconstructed pre-industrial summer SAM trends are very similar to trends obtained by model control simulations. We find that recent trends in the summer SAM lie outside the 5-95% range of pre-industrial natural variability.;"Dätwler, Christoph; Neukom, Raphael";https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/23130;2018-12-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/23130;NOAA paleoclimate database;Southern Annular Mode 1,000 Year Reconstructions;0FB6B3F2-DA62-4EB6-973E-7DC1E95CE007;154802
Reproducible climate reconstructions of the Common Era (1 CE to present) are key to placing industrial-era warming into the context of nat- ural climatic variability. Here we present a community-sourced database of temperature-sensitive proxy records from the PAGES2k initiative. The database gathers 692 records from 648 locations, including all continental regions and major ocean basins. The proxy records are from trees, ice, sediment, corals, speleothems, documentary evidence, and other archives. They range in length from 50 to 2000 years, with a median of 547 years, while temporal resolution ranges from biweekly to centennial. Nearly half of the proxy time series are significantly correlated with surface temper- ature in the HadCRUT4.2 instrumental temperature product over the period 1850-2014. Simple global composite time series show a remarkable degree of coherence between high- and low-resolution proxy archives, with broadly similar patterns across archive types, terrestrial vs marine loca- tions, and screening criteria. The database (version 2.0.0) is suited to investigations of global and regional temperature variability over the Common Era, and is shared in the Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format, including serializations in Matlab, R and Python. Also included in this repository are: - the raw data in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format - instructions on how to load the data - Quality Control figures as PDF files, bundled for various regions (including a Global bundle with all 692 pages).;"Emile-Geay, Julien; Neukom, Raphael";https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3285353.v2;2019-04-05T00:00:00Z;https://figshare.com/collections/A_global_multiproxy_database_for_temperature_reconstructions_of_the_Common_Era/3285353;Figshare;A global multiproxy database for temperature reconstructions of the Common Era;52E82241-03FA-499A-8E17-C4D46A090824;154802

From the later 3rd until the 6th century, tombs that had fallen into oblivion were frequently subject to robbery and spoliation. This phenomenon can be observed across the entirety of the late imperial and early medieval world. It is attested not only by a large quantity of legal, literary and epigraphic sources but also by archaeological evidence, since the marble decorations of tombs in particular were reused not only as spolia within walls and streets but also as décor elements within public (e.g. bath buildings, churches, latrines, fountains, nymphaea) and private buildings (villae and domus). For floors, funerary inscriptions were often visibly integrated and grave reliefs, sarcophagi and even funerary statues of the deceased were reused as ornamenta for the late antique sculpture décor. The spoliation of tombs and the transferal and reuse of funerary material can therefore be connected with major transformations of cities and societies. The aim of this research project is to collate for the first time all archaeological, epigraphic, literary and legal sources that describe the social practice of grave robbing and the associated reuse of funerary material (especially marble décor) in the late Roman empire (both the western and eastern Roman empire) in public and private contexts. With current field methods and theories of ancient urbanism, survey campaigns in Italy and Asia Minor, as well as the strong implementation of social anthropological theories (object biographies) and reception theories, new insights on the comprehensive transformation of the late antique city, society and its image world will be obtained. Furthermore, the project will place a wider focus on grave robbing or what is called grave robbery, identifying whether these phenomena occurred especially in times of major political instability from antiquity until the very modern period.;Murer, Cristina;https://boris-portal.unibe.ch/cris/project/pj00091;2022-10-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.48620/177;BORIS Portal;Plundering, Reusing and Transforming the Past: Grave Robbing and the Reuse of Funerary Material in Late Antiquity;1D4EDC48-E76F-48AA-9554-C5C19DEF001C;174174
La diversité ethnoculturelle constitue depuis plusieurs décennies un des enjeux majeurs des sociétés occidentales, où elle fait l’objet d’âpres débats politiques. Si les sciences humaines et sociales se sont largement emparées du sujet, les études littéraires l’ont jusqu’ici principalement traité sous l’angle de la littérature migrante, qui en limite la portée à l’origine des auteurs.Cet ouvrage envisage la diversité ethnoculturelle, sa gestion politique et ses conséquences sociales avant tout commeun thème littéraire prépondérant que bon nombre d’œuvres récentes approchent par les détours de la fiction. Ces mises en récit du multiculturalisme sont aussi bien des perspectives ouvertes sur un phénomène ambigu, que des outils servantà en interroger les potentiels et les limites.En mêlant analyses de textes littéraires et philosophiques, études de cas et lectures d’ouvrages d’histoire littéraire, Fabien Pillet reprend les termes du débat. Il montre, d’un côté, à quel point les œuvres de fiction se révèlent incontournables pour appréhender la diversité ethnoculturelle, et de l’autre, toute l’importance thématique que revêt le multiculturalisme lorsqu’il s’agit d’aborder nombre d’œuvres contemporaines.;Pillet, Fabien;DOI;2021-11-19T00:00:00Z;https://www.metispresses.ch/en/multiculturalisme-et-litterature-numerique;Metispresses;Multiculturalisme et littérature;3982BB42-A5F2-48E6-98D9-CD588B0D22DB;205993

"The book examines the private palaces in the Duchy of Milan during the Sforza era, designed and built between Ludovico il Moro's seizure of power in 1480 and the first quarter of the following century. The result is a catalogue of examples that are essential for understanding the development of the typology and the emergence of a new housing model capable of including, among its functions, that of representing, by fixing it in a building, the social, political and cultural role of the client. Extensive chapters are devoted to the individual palazzi, which we can recognise - in the famous expression of Pietro Aretino - as ""modernly ancient and antiquely modern"". These chapters analyse them from various perspectives and lead to the identification of an innovative line in Lombard art, not only through examples in Milan, but also by means of precise verifications in Pavia, Piacenza, Lodi, Cremona, Crema and Vigevano, in parallel with what was happening in Florence or Venice, in Mantua or Ferrara and finally, at a slightly later date, in Rome. Through the analysis of the general advancement of architectural culture as a whole and of the interconnections between building sites, craftsmen and linguistic inventions, the range of architectures considered widens considerably to include some crucial religious buildings and, subsequently, several Roman palaces, where the descent of the ""Lombards"" - from Bramante from Urbino, by then integrated in Milanese cultural circles, to Bramantino and Cristoforo Solari - paved the way for decisive and critically inescapable exchanges";MARTINIS, ROBERTA;9788822911636;2021-02-27T00:00:00Z;https://repository.supsi.ch/12412/;SUPSI;Anticamente moderni.

Crown birds are subdivided into two main groups, Palaeognathae and Neognathae, that can be distinguished, among other means, by the organization of the bones in their pterygoidpalatine complex (PPC). Shape variation of the vomer, which is the most anterior part of the PPC, was recently analysed with help of geometric morphometrics to discover morphological differences between palaeognath and neognath birds. Based on this study, the vomer was identified as sufficient to distinguish the two main groups (and even some inclusive neognath groups) and their cranial kinetic system. As there are notable size differences between the skulls of Palaeognathae and Neognathae, we here investigate the impact of allometry on vomeral shape and its implication for taxonomic classification by re-analysing the data of the previous study. Different types of multivariate statistical analyses reveal that taxonomic identification based on vomeral shape is strongly impaired by allometry, as the error of correct identification is high when shape data is corrected for size. This finding is evidenced by a great overlap between palaeognath and neognath subclades in morphospace. Correct taxonomic identification is further impeded by the convergent presence of a flattened vomeral morphotype in multiple neognath subclades. As the evolution of cranial kinesis has been linked to vomeral shape in the original study, the correlation between shape and size of the vomer across different bird groups found in the present study questions this conclusion. In fact, cranial kinesis in crown birds results from the loss of the jugal-postorbital bar in the temporal region and ectopterygoid in the PPC and the combination of a mobilized quadratezygomatic arch complex and a flexible PPC. Therefore, we can conclude that vomer shape itself is not a suitable proxy for exploring the evolution of cranial kinesis in crown birds and their ancestors. In contrast, the evolution of cranial kinesis needs to be viewed in context of the braincase, quadrate-zygomatic arch and the whole pterygoid-palatine complex.;"Foth, Christian; Plateau, Olivia";"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.184101 ";2021-04-14T00:00:00Z;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.184101v3.supplementary-material;Biorxiv;The impact of allometry on vomer shape and its implications for the taxonomy and cranial kinesis of crown-group birds;4EFA0F69-CA75-42A0-86DA-C119317712C2;174040

"This legal dissertation is dedicated to the topic of people analytics in private law employment relationships. People Analytics refers to the practice of personnel development in which digital data from internal and external sources relating to human capital are systematically evaluated using information technology in order to make decisions that increase the value of a company. The author begins by identifying the differences between people analytics and older forms of monitoring in the workplace as well as the resulting legal problems. After considering the various applicable fields of law, he focuses on the analysis of employment and data protection law. Key findings include the following three facts: that data protection regulations, which are predominantly procedural in nature, must be interpreted in a risk-oriented manner; that, in the work context, consent should be avoided as a reason to justify data processing; and that there are deficiencies in the enforcement of data protection in private law. Based on this, the author develops an improvement concept aimed at professionalising and democratising data protection law. He contrasts his theoretical considerations with the empirical data that he has collected as part of an interdisciplinary research project. In addition to the existing Swiss Data Protection Act, this dissertation takes into account the proposals for the future, fully revised Swiss Data Protection Act, the EU General Data Protection Regulation and selected aspects of US data protection law.The dissertation has won the Stefano Rodotà Award of the Council of Europe and the Professor Walther Hug Prize.";Kasper, Gabriel;https://doi.org/10.3256/978-3-03929-009-3;2021-08-30T00:00:00Z;https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/262428/;Alexandria;People Analytics in privatrechtlichen Arbeitsverhältnissen;FDD949C5-FC7A-4188-935E-D0873CA74822;201503

Bite traces on fossil bones are key to deciphering feeding ecology and trophic interactions of vertebrate past ecosystems. However, similarities between traces produced by different carnivorous taxa with similar dentitions and misidentifications due to equifinality hinder confident identifications of the bite makers. Here, we correlate bite traces with macroscopic wear and microanatomy of the teeth of the pseudosuchian archosaur Batrachotomus kupferzellensis from the Triassic Lower Keuper fossil lagerstätten (southern Germany), untangling its feeding habits and shedding light on the bite traces generated by ziphodont teeth (teeth with serrated carinae). Individually, bite traces reflect tooth morphology, whereas composite bite traces and their frequency are related to feeding behaviour and explain tooth macroscopic wear and microanatomy. Therefore the identification of the bite maker is possible by analysing composite bite traces, their location on bones, and their relative abundance. In addition, tooth macroscopic wear and microanatomy are proven as independent lines of evidence of feeding ecology. Comparing bite traces on fossil and present-day bone assemblages, we observe that bone modifications by the crocodylomorph lineage (from Triassic pseudosuchian archosaurs to extinct and extant crocodylians) are strikingly similar, including taxa with and without ziphodont teeth. Such a set of features differs from bone modification assemblages produced by taxa with similar ziphodont teeth outside the pseudosuchian lineage (such as theropod dinosaurs and the Komodo monitor), suggesting a phylogenetic signal in feeding ecology among saurian reptiles.;"Foth, Christian; Maxwell, Erin; Mujal, Eudald; Schoch, Rainer; Seegis, Dieter";"https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.stqjq2c4b ";2022-03-31T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.stqjq2c4b;Dryad;Feeding habits of the Middle Triassic pseudosuchian Batrachotomus kupferzellensis from Germany and palaeoecological implications for archosaurs;0167DD9C-99E4-428A-95A1-FD428D0B2412;174040

Model simulations and proxy-based reconstructions are the main tools for quantifying pre-instrumental climate variations. For some metrics such as Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures, there is remarkable agreement between models and reconstructions. For other diagnostics, such as the regional response to volcanic eruptions, or hemispheric temperature differences, substantial disagreements between data and models have been reported. Here, we assess the potential sources of these discrepancies by comparing 1000-year hemispheric temperature reconstructions based on real-world paleoclimate proxies with climate-model-based pseudoproxies. These pseudoproxy experiments (PPE) indicate that noise inherent in proxy records and the unequal spatial distribution of proxy data are the key factors in explaining the data-model differences. For example, lower inter-hemispheric correlations in reconstructions can be fully accounted for by these factors in the PPE. Noise and data sampling also partly explain the reduced amplitude of the response to external forcing in reconstructions compared to models. For other metrics, such as inter-hemispheric differences, some, although reduced, discrepancy remains. Our results suggest that improving proxy data quality and spatial coverage is the key factor to increase the quality of future climate reconstructions, while the total number of proxy records and reconstruction methodology play a smaller role.;Neukom, Raphael;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/23890;2018-12-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/23890;NOAA paleoclimate database;Hemispheric 1,000 Year Pseudoproxy Data and Temperature Reconstructions;D4ADE956-C868-4444-911C-08DA84527F96;154802

Abstract The bacterial division apparatus catalyses the synthesis and remodelling of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) to build the cell wall layer that fortifies the daughter cell poles. Understanding of this essential process has been limited by the lack of native three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli . We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the septal architecture and mode of division can be modified to more closely resemble that of other Gram-negative ( Caulobacter crescentus ) or Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria, suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the formation of different septal morphologies. Finally, analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation (Δ envC Δ nlpD ) showed that cell wall remodelling affects the placement and stability of the cytokinetic ring. Taken together, our results support a model in which competition between the cell elongation and division machineries determines the shape of cell constrictions and the poles they form. They also highlight how the activity of the division system can be modulated to help generate the diverse array of shapes observed in the bacterial domain.;"Allolio, Christoph; Ananda, Virly Y.; Bernhardt, Thomas G.; Chao, Luke H.; Llopis, Paula Montero; Navarro, Paula P.; Vettiger, Andrea";EMD-27485;2022-09-12T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-27485;EMDB;Cell wall synthesis and remodelling dynamics determine division site architecture and cell shape in Escherichia coli;74095512-9EB7-4A88-9DEB-8CEA9A94A614;188112

Il volume ricostruisce, avvalendosi di un ampio scavo archivistico, uno degli aspetti meno noti dell’esilio risorgimentale: il sequestro dei patrimoni di coloro che furono costretti ad abbandonare il suolo patrio. Nel 1853, quando il feldmaresciallo Radetzky, governatore generale del Regno Lombardo-Veneto, impartì l’ordine di sequestrare i beni degli esuli politici, la macchina amministrativa asburgica si mise lentamente in moto, impossessandosi temporaneamente delle loro fortune. Privati delle consuete rendite, gli uomini e le donne trasferitisi oltreconfine furono profondamente toccati dai provvedimenti di sequestro, che fornirono nuovi argomenti alla leggenda nera del malgoverno austriaco sulle province italiane dell’impero.Queste pagine ripercorrono quelle vicende da una prospettiva economica, sociale e giuridica, indagandole nell’agire dell’amministrazione austriaca, nelle traversie degli emigrati colpiti dai provvedimenti e nelle difficoltà delle loro famiglie rimaste in patria. Ne emerge un quadro vivido, nel quale il legame tra politica e proprietà si esplicita in un intreccio tra controllo pubblico, prassi burocratica e strategie famigliari.;Girardi, Giacomo;10.52056/9791254691823;;https://www.viella.it/libro/9791254690093;Viella;I beni degli esuli.

Résumé du livre - Trajectoires et transitionsPar leurs caractéristiques diverses, les maladies chroniques ont une résonance sociale, économique, biomédicale et politique. En comparant l’expérience quotidienne de malades atteints de rhumatismes inflammatoires et de malades atteints d’insuffisance rénale chronique, cet ouvrage - issu d’une thèse de doctorat - analyse les conséquences de ces pathologies sur la vie quotidienne des personnes affectées, les facteurs qui contribuent à leur émergence et les stratégies de gestion développées par les malades. À travers un regard éclectique du vécu des patients, il permet de comprendre comment les malades vivent et perçoivent leur maladie. La compréhension de l’expérience subjective de la maladie chronique contribue à mieux cibler la réflexion concernant les réels besoins des malades, permettant aux professionnels de la santé d’adapter leurs pratiques professionnelles et au milieu politique de mieux ajuster les politiques sociosanitaires.;Ribeiro, Carla;10.32551/GEORG.12818.;2022-02-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.georg.ch/trajectoires-et-transitions;"DOI sont déposés chez Crossref ";Trajectoires et transitions - Le vécu quotidien de la maladie chronique;2A8C4AAC-9B20-42DF-B501-C6865027F1BC;208606

Vor seiner Zeit als Reformator war Joachim Vadian als huma­nis­tischer Gelehrter und Dozent aktiv. Gespeist aus seinen Vorlesungen entstanden die lateinischen Kommentare zur Weltbeschreibung des ältesten römischen Geografen, Pomponius Mela, der in der frühen Neuzeit ein viel gelesener Autor war. Die zweite, streitlustigere, ausschweifendere und persönlichere Edition des Kommentarwerks, 1522 in Basel gedruckt, wurde zum bedeutendsten humanistischen Werk ­Vadians.Der Kommentarliteratur eilt der Ruf voraus, langweilig zu sein, doch Vadians Erläuterungen sind sehr frei und vielfältig gestaltet. Didaktisch ausgefeilt wird der Leser an die Diskussion um die Klimazonen der Erde und die Existenz der Antipoden herangeführt, gelehrte Standpunkte werden hitzig vertreten und Reiseberichte aus dem eigenen Erfahrungsschatz dramatisch zum Besten gegeben, während neue geografische Erkenntnisse kritisch zu antiken und mittelalterlichen Quellen in Bezug gesetzt und diskutiert werden. Die vorliegende Studie stellt den Kommentartext ins Zentrum, um das Spannungsverhältnis zwischen altem und neuem Wissen, zwischen antikem Autor und humanistischem Kommentator sichtbar zu machen. Neben den Kommentierungsstrategien zeigt die Arbeit anhand übersetzter Textbeispiele auf, wie Vadian selbst als Schreiber hervortritt, das eigene Wissen, persönliche Anliegen und Biografisches auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen mit der antiken Weltbeschreibung verknüpft.;Suter-Meyer, Katharina;DOI 10.33057/chronos.1581;2020-09-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.chronos-verlag.ch/node/27403;Open Access Chronos Verlag;Wissensvermittler – Kritiker – Autor, Joachim Vadians Kommentare zu Pomponius Mela (Basel, 1522);0633F515-A00B-40D6-B5FA-31CEA0A22748;193918

Seit einiger Zeit ist Brasiliens Neokonkretismus in Ausstellungen, Katalogen und Publikationen in Europa präsent. Die Autorin nimmt erstmals auf Deutsch umfassende Werkanalysen vor und stellt den Schlüsselcharakter der neokonkreten Praktiken dar. Die Kunst- und Lyrikproduktion der Bewegung führte, so die Autorin, zu einer Umwertung und Neuauslegung des konkret-konstruktivistischen Gedankenguts der europäischen Avantgarden des frühen 20. Jahrhunderts. Diese Umwertungen schufen in Brasilien erst die Voraussetzungen dafür, haptische und sensorielle Komponenten ästhetischen Erlebens zum zentralen Ausgangspunkt künstlerischer Praxis zu erheben, für welche die späteren Arbeiten der brasilianischen Avantgarde-Ikonen Lygia Clark und Hélio Oiticica bekannt sind. Die Arbeit ist ein wichtiger Beitrag dazu, moderne und zeitgenössische künstlerische Praktiken aus Brasilien zu dekolonisieren, denn die Analysen zeigen auf, dass haptisch und plurisensoriell erfahrbare Kunstwerke aus Brasilien eben nicht auf einer angenommenen genuin sensorisch-sensiblen Konstituierung des Menschen in Brasilien beruhen, sondern vielmehr auf einer eigenwilligen, lokalen Rezeption europäischer Avantgardepraktiken.;Bachmann, Pauline;10.3726/b15507;2019-06-11T00:00:00Z;https://www.peterlang.com/view/title/68380;Peter Lang Verlag;Pure Leiblichkeit.

The relationship between design and critique proves to be ambiguous. In its interventionist and constructive nature, design shares with other critical practices the premise of the shapeability and alterability of cultural, social, and political realities. Design can be seen as inherently critical and speculative as it sets out to project novel relationships between people, systems, and things from what it diagnoses as the status quo. At the same time, design is inevitably normative, if not often violent, as it partakes in stabilizing the past, normalizing the present condition and precluding just and sustainable futures. In the same way as design can unfold and make experienceable social boundaries, values and norms embedded in our material and visual culture, it is a major contributor to their manifestation and obscuration in the first place. This anthology aims to unpack the ambivalent tensions between design and critique. The contributions foster a vital rethinking of the foundational concepts and notions of critique that influence the field of design, question inherent blind spots and ideologies of the discipline, and expand understandings of what critical design practices could be.;"Bardzell, Jeffrey; Bardzell, Shaowen; Bianca , Elzenbaum; Büsse , Michaela; De Visscher, Emile; Di Salvo, Carl; Fezer , Jesko; Franke, Björn; Geiger , Annette; Greoiner-Petter, Moritz; Groten , Anja; Hardt , Meike; Julier , Guy; Quinz , Emanuele; Reklies , Mara; Ward , Matt; Wsseling , Janneke; Zdziarska, Patrycja";https://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-6104-0/critical-by-design/;2022-03-29T00:00:00Z;https://www.transcript-verlag.de/media/pdf/64/6f/39/oa9783839461044phFNbngHPS4Dw.pdf;transcript Verlag, Idependent Academic Publishing;Critical by Design?

"Neben der relativ eigenständigen Tradition der musikalischen Formenlehre wird im deutschsprachigen Kulturraum seit dem 19. Jahrhundert in Musikästhetik und Musikkritik die essentielle Frage, wie das Konzept von «Form in Musik» überhaupt angemessen zu verstehen sei, kontrovers diskutiert. Die Untersuchung «Konzeptualisierung von Form in Musik» demonstriert, dass sich seit ca. 1800 entscheidende Einflüsse auf die Auffassung von «Form in Musik» aus der breiteren Ideengeschichte sowie aus philosophischer Ästhetik und experimenteller Psychologie herleiten. Anhand wichtiger Tendenzen wie der Entwicklung des ästhetischen Formalismus, der ‹allgemeinen Kunstwissenschaften› (Max Dessoir), der Wirkung phänomenologischen Denkens und der Gestalttheorie auf die Musiktheorie werden essentielle Stationen, Entwicklungen und Wendepunkte der Diskurse über «Form in Musik» analysiert. Aus dieser transdisziplinären Perspektive heraus wird deutlich, dass ein subjektbezogener Formbegriff immer stärker in den Vordergrund rückt.

"Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, the emergence of airports as gateways for their cities has turned into one of the most important architectural undertakings. Ever since the first manned flight by the Brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright on December 17th 1903, utilitarian sheds next to landing strips on cow pastures evolved into a completely new building type over the next few decades - into places of Modernism as envisioned by Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright (who themselves never built an airport), to eventually turn into icons of cultural identity, progress and prosperity. In Europe, military aerodromes created during the First World War, such as Bourget and Croydon airports in France and Great Britain respectively, were transformed into civilian airport terminals.Many of these airports have become architectural branding devices of their respective cities, regions and countries, created by some of the most notable contemporary architects.. This interdisciplinary cultural study deals with the historical formation and transformation of the architectural typology of airports under the aspect of spatial theories. This includes the shift from early spaces of transportation such as train stations, the synesthetic effect of travel and mobility and the effects of material innovations on the development, occupation and use of such spaces. The changing uses from mere utilitarian transportation spaces to ones centered on the spectacular culture of late capitalism, consumption and identity formation in a rapidly changing global culture are analyzed with examples both from architectural and philosophical points of view. The origins of this glass and iron architecture can be traced to Joseph Paxton’s Crystal Palace, built for the Great Exhibition of 1851. This was the first time that the exhibition venue itself took a backseat to its architecture. The composition of the interior and the perception thereof were of a fluid nature with myriads of possibilities for interior design. The crystalline exhibition and dwelling premises of the Crystal Palace were the idealized interiors where the enlightened citizens dwelled and strolled as analyzed in Walter Benjamin’s Arcades Project, they were consequently recreated in arcades, tea rooms, cafés and grand train stations at the turn of the century, setting the stage for what would become urban realm and airport architecture. Much like ubiquitous modern day coffee shops, airports aim to be the third place as per Ray Oldenburg, but are rather a non-place according to Marc Augé and a Foucauldian interplay between heterotopias, utopias and dystopias. Many have become nightmarish panopticons of migration, surveillance and control, triggered by the events surrounding the terrorist attacks of the last two decades. Current airport design puts an emphasis on the regional and anthropological place to counteract the dehumanization of mass transportation. Its transitory character is fused with art exhibition sites, culminating in airport-museum-hybrids, such as Mumbai and Doha airports. The future of airport architecture and design very much looks like the original idea of the Crystal Palace: to provide a stage for consumption, social theatre and art exhibition.

"Participant à l’organisation et à la mise en forme du monde, les frontières apparaissent également comme des lignes de forces dans de nombreuses œuvres littéraires. Périphériques ou centrales, statiques ou dynamiques, explicites ou implicites, pleines ou creuses, précaires ou tenaces, elles signalent des points de rupture ou des zones d’attraction dans les textes. Donnant lieu aux expériences les plus variées, elles engagent des formes et des esthétiques très différenciées.À partir de cet objet commun, et en convoquant les débats récents sur la littérature mondiale, cet ouvrage invite à un voyage à travers les littératures de langue française.

Streamingdienste, Vinylflohmärkte, die verstaubte CD-Sammlung - nie gab es so viele Möglichkeiten auf Musik zuzugreifen wie heute. In Form ethnografischer Tracks zeigt Christian Elster, was Musiksammeln zwischen Plattenladen und Onlinediensten für Menschen bedeuten kann. Hierfür beleuchtet er Praktiken, Artefakte, Orte, Diskurse und Figuren des Sammelns und zeigt auf, dass die technisch grundierte und sinnliche Praxis wesentlich auf das Selbstverständnis vieler Menschen Einfluss nimmt. Sammeln kann deshalb als Alltagskompetenz verstanden werden, die in physischen und digitalen Umgebungen individuelle Ordnungen und sinnstiftende Wegmarken schafft.;"Elster, Christian; SNF,";https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839455272;2020-12-09T00:00:00Z;https://www.transcript-verlag.de/media/pdf/bb/10/23/oa9783839455272.pdf;Transcript Verlag;Pop-Musik sammeln;AEC645B5-34B2-4A6B-BE2F-AE5C7B7D20C1;196855
"Less than a year after the end of authoritarian rule in 1998, huge images of Jesus Christ and Christian scenes proliferated on walls and billboards around a provincial town in eastern Indonesia in a conflict pitting Muslims against Christians. A manifestation of the extreme perception that emerged amidst the uncertainty and challenge to seeing brought on by urban warfare, the street paintings erected by Protestant motorbike-taxi drivers signaled a radical departure from the aniconic tradition of the old colonial church, a desire to be seen and recognized by political authorities from Jakarta to the UN and European Union, an aim to reinstate the Christian look of a city in the face of widespread islamicization, and an opening to a more intimate relationship to the divine through the bringing-into-vision of the Christian god. Stridently assertive, these affectively charged mediations of religion, masculinity, Christian privilege and subjectivity are only one among the myriad ephemera of war and its aftermath analyzed in the book from graffiti, incendiary pamphlets and Video CDs to Peace Provocateur text-messages and children’s reconciliation drawings. In Orphaned Landscapes, Patricia Spyer theorizes the production of the monumental street art and other visual media as part of a wider work on appearance in which ordinary people refigure and transform the aesthetic forms and sensory environment of their urban surrounds. The book offers a nuanced account of a place in crisis and motion and an analysis of how the work on appearance, far from epiphenomenal, is inherent to significant sociopolitical change in Indonesia as elsewhere.

This book, thesis presented at Fribourg university in 2016 by Thierry Audric is the history of the first 150 years of Chinese reverse glass painting.From its origins in Canton in the early eighteenth century up until the mid-nineteenth century, Chinese reverse glass painting was associated with the commercial and cultural meeting of the West and China, captivating the upper classes of both these civilizations.After the Opium Wars, this international artform became exclusively Chinese and continues to be so today.The book has 240 pages, 102 illustrations in the text and 432 pictures in Appendix I, bibliography and index.;Audric, thierry;DOI:https://doi.org/10.3726/b16542;2020-03-17T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.3726/b16542;Peter Lang publishing;"Chinese reverse glass painting ";6140115A-75AB-45E9-8E2E-DC3507BB4CC3;187790
"The book examines the private palaces in the Duchy of Milan during the Sforza era, designed and built between Ludovico il Moro's seizure of power in 1480 and the first quarter of the following century. The result is a catalogue of examples that are essential for understanding the development of the typology and the emergence of a new housing model capable of including, among its functions, that of representing, by fixing it in a building, the social, political and cultural role of the client.Extensive chapters are devoted to the individual palazzi, which we can recognise - in the famous expression of Pietro Aretino - as ""modernly ancient and antiquely modern"". These chapters analyse them from various perspectives and lead to the identification of an innovative line in Lombard art, not only through examples in Milan, but also with precise verifications in Pavia, Piacenza, Lodi, Cremona, Crema and Vigevano, in parallel with what was happening in Florence or Venice, in Mantua or Ferrara and finally, at a slightly later date, in Rome.Through the analysis of the general advancement of architectural culture as a whole and of the interconnections between building sites, craftsmen and linguistic inventions, the range of architectures considered widens considerably to include some crucial religious buildings and, subsequently, several Roman palaces, where the descent of the ""Lombards"" - from Bramante from Urbino, by then integrated in Milanese cultural circles, to Bramantino and Cristoforo Solari - paved the way for decisive and critically inescapable exchanges.";MARTINIS, ROBERTA;9788822911636;2021-02-27T00:00:00Z;https://www.quodlibet.it/libro/9788822911636;Quodlibet publishing house;Anticamente moderni.

Triathlon boomt. Der kräftezehrenden Verbindung von ­Schwim­men, Radfahren und Laufen verschreiben sich auch in der Schweiz immer mehr Menschen. Längst besitzt der Sport prominente Aushänge­schilder. Anbieter konkurrieren mit ­immer herausfordernderen Wettkämpfen und verschieben so die Machbarkeitsvorstellungen von Athletinnen und Athleten. Triathlon verändert den Alltag: Er wird zu einem umfassenden Lebensstil.Seiner Aufschlüsselung widmet sich dieses Buch aus einer kulturwissenschaftlich-anthropologischen Per­spektive. Die Autorin macht die eigenen Erfahrungen als Triathletin zum Ausgangspunkt einer ethnografischen Untersuchung. Sie gibt Einblicke in Selbstbilder, Körperkonzepte und Szenenwissen, in Emotionen und Rituale auf der Suche nach den Grenzvorstellungen und zeigt die Erfahrungsdimensionen von Körper, Bewegung und Raum im Rahmen dieser sportlichen Trias in ihrer Vielschichtigkeit auf.Was die Wechselzone und das Trainingslager mit methodischen Erhebungen zu tun haben, ist ebenso Thema wie Finisher-­T-Shirts, die eine Geschichte von vergangenen Leistungen erzählen. So hilft Babypuder nicht nur beim Anziehen eines ­Neoprens, sondern signa­lisiert Wissensbestände, Lebensstile und Exklusivität, durch die das Triathletendasein bezeugt wird. Die Studie fragt zudem, wie Leistungsvorstellungen, Streckenerleben und Technologien zusammenhängen, analysiert die entstehenden Bedeutungs­zuschreibungen, zeigt Varianten von Schmerzen auf und legt offen, wie der Ironman Hawaii zu einem modernen ­Mythos wer­den konnte.;Krahn, Yonca;10.33057/chronos.1607;2021-12-20T00:00:00Z;https://www.chronos-verlag.ch/public-download/3254;Chronos Verlag;Triathlon – auf der Strecke und darüber hinaus.

Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers revolutionized long-haul optical communications and laser technology. Erbium ions could provide a basis for efficient optical amplification in photonic integrated circuits but their use remains impractical as a result of insufficient output power. We demonstrate a photonic integrated circuit-based erbium amplifier reaching 145 milliwatts of output power and more than 30 decibels of small-signal gain-on par with commercial fiber amplifiers and surpassing state-of-the-art III-V heterogeneously integrated semiconductor amplifiers. We apply ion implantation to ultralow-loss silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) photonic integrated circuits, which are able to increase the soliton microcomb output power by 100 times, achieving power requirements for low-noise photonic microwave generation and wavelength-division multiplexing optical communications. Endowing Si 3 N 4 photonic integrated circuits with gain enables the miniaturization of various fiber-based devices such as high-pulse-energy femtosecond mode-locked lasers.;"Hafermann, Martin; He, Jijun; Ji, Xinru; Kippenberg, Tobias J.; Liu, Junqiu; Liu, Yang; Lukashchuk, Anton; Qiu, Zheru; Riemensberger, Johann; Ronning, Carsten; Wang, Rui Ning";10.5281/zenodo.6515905;2022-06-17T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6515905;zenodo;A photonic integrated circuit–based erbium-doped amplifier;81ABD41B-09D4-4908-8B37-2C091B4D2308;176563

The three supplementary files include one figure displaying the results of X-ray microtomography (File S1), two compilations of figures dealing with the volume change measurement (Files S2 and S3) and a table with the measured compositions in major and trace elements (Table S1).File S1 (Malvoisin_ds01.pdf). Result of X-ray microtomography. Olivine and Fe-brucite have a similar attenuation. The grains segmented by selecting this attenuation are displayed with a circle with a size proportional to the radius of a sphere of equivalent volume. The color of each circle depends on e, the aspect ratio (ratio of the length of the minimum and maximum axes of an ellipsoid fitted to each grain). The white arrow indicates the location of the main central vein. Grains near the main central vein have a lower e attributed to the platy habitus of Fe-brucite. The other grains are considered as olivine and used for the calculation of the extent of reaction.File S2 (Malvoisin_ds02.pdf). Optical photomicrographs used to calculate volume change during reaction (see main text for details about the calculation). Olivine grains (white) are surrounded by the serpentine + brucite mixture (light green to yellowish). The magnetite/clinopyroxene platelets are mapped in blue in olivine and in red in the serpentine + brucite mixture. The results of the model fitting the best the average orientation of the platelets in olivine are shown in green. The title of each photomicrograph provides the minimum and maximum estimates for volume change calculated with this model (see details about the calculation in the main text), and the size of the bottom right scale bar.File S3 (Malvoisin_ds03.pdf). Histograms of magnetite/clinopyroxene platelet orientation (in degree). Each histogram corresponds to a photomicrograph of File S1. The order of the histograms and the photomicrographs is the same. The orientations in the olivine grains, the serpentine + brucite mixture and for the model fitting the best the average orientation in olivine are displayed in blue, red and green, respectively. The title of the histograms provides the standard deviation of the platelet orientation in the olivine grains (STDoli), the serpentine + brucite mixture (STDori) and calculated with the model fitting the best the orientation in olivine (STDcal).Table S1 (Malvoisin_ds01.xlsx).

In the presentation we show a time-lapse sequence of a T=50 years flood and seismically-derived bedload and discharge estimates. We observe a rapid change in regime, from a braiding to meandering (outer bend erosion of alternate river-banks), and large amounts of sediment that are released downstream. (Open) Questions that follow are: Will the original regime be restored and at what time-scale? What role does the morphological evolution of these reaches play in the storage and transfer of sediment (taking into account their response to large magnitude events)?;"Bakker, Maarten; Borgniet, Laurent; Gimbert, Florent; Misset, Clément; Recking, Alain";https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-13821;2020-05-04T00:00:00Z;https://presentations.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-13821_presentation.pptx;EGU General Assembly 2020 Sharing Geoscience Online;Séveraisse River flood October 2019;6362CE73-7A2A-43DA-949B-8634963B04F6;181420

Most learn-to-swim programmes focus heavily on swimming proficiency learnt in swimming pools potentially at the expense of learning other important survival skills in open water environments. However, most drownings occur in open water environments (Water Safety New Zealand, 2019). In previous work Button et al. (2020) have shown that teaching children water safety skills in open water helped improve competencies when the children were retested in a battery of tests conducted in a swimming pool. A necessary extension of this work is to ascertain whether the benefits of children learning in open water are retained when they are tested in such environments. Hence the rationale for the research is to investigate whether tests of water safety competency conducted in the open water discern differences between groups of children taught in a swimming pool (control) versus a group taught in the same open water environment.;van Duijn, Tina;https://osf.io/6rsnz/?view_only=74dcf3d70c094104884996024efc8e67;;https://osf.io/6rsnz/?view_only=74dcf3d70c094104884996024efc8e67;Open Science Framework;Testing children’s water competencies in an open water environmen;3295670A-8C03-4454-A4F8-978A72B86E26;187632

"This data set contains model output data from the regional ocean modelling system (ROMS) that was set up for the Southern Ocean (south of 24 °S; Haumann, 2016) to analyze the effects of changing surface freshwater and momentum fluxes on Southern Ocean water-mass changes over the period 1980 to 2011. All data is provided in NetCDF format. The data set contains 3 sets 40-year long model spin-up, control, and 3 perturbation simulations each. The sets differ by their model mean state to assess the effect of surface salinity biases on the results. One set of simulations are reference simulations where salinity is restored to the observed surface salinity during model spin-up, and the other two sets are simulations in which the restoring surface salinity has been altered by plus and minus 0.1 PSU, respectively. The control and perturbation simulations are 40-year extensions of the respective model spin-up simulations. In the perturbation simulations either the surface freshwater fluxes or momentum fluxes are instantaneously perturbed after the spin-up simulation to reflect the observation-derived changes in these surface fluxes and then held constant (at the perturbed level) for 40 years. They consist of sea-ice freshwater flux, glacial meltwater flux, and atmosphere-ocean momentum flux changes.

Engineering of nonlinear optical response in nanostructures is one of the key topics in nanophotonics, as it allows for broad frequency conversion at the nanoscale. Nevertheless, the application of the developed designs is limited by either high cost of their manufacturing or low conversion efficiencies. This paper reports on the efficient second-harmonic generation in a free-standing GaP nanowire array encapsulated in a polymer membrane. Light coupling with optical resonances and field confinement in the nanowires together with high nonlinearity of GaP material yield a strong second-harmonic signal and efficient near-infrared (800-1200 nm) to visible upconversion. The fabricated nanowire-based membranes demonstrate high flexibility and semitransparency for the incident infrared radiation, allowing utilizing them for infrared imaging, which can be easily integrated into different optical schemes without disturbing the visualized beam.;Timofeeva, Maria;10.1021/acsnano.0c04872;2020-08-25T00:00:00Z;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/439005;ETH server;Gallium Phosphide Nanowires in a Free-Standing, Flexible, and Semitransparent Membrane for Large-Scale Infrared-to-Visible Light Conversion;891E7E81-8A61-4D31-B87F-CA9F408A888D;179966

Inferring the evolutionary history of cognitive abilities requires large and diverse samples. However, such samples are often beyond the reach of individual researchers or institutions, and studies are often limited to small numbers of species. Consequently, methodological and site-specific-differences across studies can limit comparisons between species. Here we introduce the ManyPrimates project, which addresses these challenges by providing a large-scale collaborative framework for comparative studies in primate cognition. To demonstrate the viability of the project we conducted a case study of short-term memory. In this initial study, we were able to include 176 individuals from 12 primate species housed at 11 sites across Africa, Asia, North America and Europe. All subjects were tested in a delayed-response task using consistent methodology across sites. Individuals could access food rewards by remembering the position of the hidden reward after a 0, 15, or 30-second delay. Overall, individuals performed better with shorter delays, as predicted by previous studies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a strong phylogenetic signal for short-term memory. Although, with only 12 species, the validity of this analysis is limited, our initial results demonstrate the feasibility of a large, collaborative open-science project. We present the ManyPrimates project as an exciting opportunity to address open questions in primate cognition and behaviour with large, diverse datasets.;Primates, Many;tr6q3;2018-02-15T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/tr6q3/;OSF;Establishing an infrastructure for collaboration in primate cognition research;C3A3BF6D-2C6F-4EC2-8B9A-0D7AF75A5423;175269
Reciprocity is a ubiquitous and important human trait. Still, the evolutionary origin is largely unclear, partly because it is believed that our closest living relatives, other primates, do not reciprocate help. Consequently, reciprocity is suggested to have evolved in the human linage only. However, our systematic review of studies investigating reciprocity in non-human primates revealed that, contrary to common perception, there are more positive than negative findings in both experimental and observational studies. Furthermore, we argue that negative findings can provide important insights. We found that reciprocity is not confined to unrelated individuals. In addition, reciprocity can be influenced by the choice of experimental design, relationship quality, social services and temporal scales. Thus, negative findings should not be used as evidence of no reciprocity but as the building blocks for a more comprehensive theory. Based on our review, we conclude that reciprocity in primates is present but underestimated. We close by suggesting further steps that could pave the way for future research aimed at understanding the evolutionary origins of reciprocity.;"Call, Josep; Schweinfurth, Manon K.";10.17630/92fb3b2b-85a5-4c9f-ae80-e29b61740b18;2019-07-07T00:00:00Z;https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/revisiting-the-possibility-of-reciprocal-help-in-nonhuman-primates(92fb3b2b-85a5-4c9f-ae80-e29b61740b18).html;PURE, St Andrews;Revisiting the possibility of reciprocal help in non-human primates;4C864A42-F8BD-4835-A206-436EFAE897A6;175269

Objective Standardized face-to-face interviews are widely used to collect data in low and middle-income countries for social science and health research. Such interviews can be long and tedious. In an attempt to improve the respondents’ experience during interviews, we developed a concept of gamified interview by including a game element. Gamification is reported to increase engagement in tasks, but results from rigorously developed research are equivocal, and a theory of gamification is still needed. Materials & methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial to rigorously evaluate the proposed gamification based on the self-determination theory, specifically on the basic psychological needs theory. In total, 1266 respondents were interviewed. Single and multiple mediation analyses were used to understand how gamification works. Results Our evaluation showed that the gamification we had developed did not improve the outcome, i.e. the reported experience of the interview. The effect of gamification depended on the ability of respondents: gamification can be counterproductive if it overburdens the respondents. Finally, the basic psychological needs theory explained the mechanisms of action of gamification well: feeling competent and related to others improved the reported experience of the interview. Conclusion We emphasize the need to develop context-specific gamification and invite researchers to follow equivalently rigorous evaluation of gamification in future studies.;"Aubert, A.H.; Friedrich, M.N.D.";10.25678/0002K9;2021-02-01T00:00:00Z;https://opendata.eawag.ch/dataset/gamifying-quantitative-face-to-face-interviews;Eawag Eric;"Data for: Gamifying quantitative face-to-face interviews in rural India ";F77D3906-3590-408C-9137-01581CDD4213;173973
The deep seabed is a vast mosaic of poorly-sampled habitats hosting surprisingly high levels of biodiversity that remains mostly undescribed. The sheer amount of rare, small-size taxa and the vast spatial extent of the abyssal seafloor complicates biodiversity and biogeography studies, but baselines must be established for regions such as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) that may be destroyed by polymetallic nodule mining. Environmental genomics may help for this task and for biomonitoring but needs to be assessed thoroughly. We sequenced environmental DNA and RNA for 310 deep-sea sediments samples (2 PCR replicates/sample) from the CCZ and other regions distributed globally, targeting Foraminifera (37F) and Eukaryota (V1V2).The deep seabed is a vast mosaic of poorly-sampled habitats hosting surprisingly high levels of biodiversity that remains mostly undescribed.

Abstract Healthy adipose tissue remodeling depends on the balance between de novo adipogenesis from adipogenic progenitor cells and the hypertrophy of adipocytes. De novo adipogenesis has been shown to promote healthy adipose tissue expansion, which confers protection from obesity-associated insulin resistance. Here, we define the role and trajectory of different adipogenic precursor subpopulations and further delineate the mechanism and cellular trajectory of adipogenesis, using single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of murine adipogenic precursors. We identify Rspo2 as a functional regulator of adipogenesis, which is secreted by a subset of CD142 + cells to inhibit maturation of early progenitors through the receptor Lgr4. Increased circulating RSPO2 in mice leads to adipose tissue hypertrophy and insulin resistance and increased RSPO2 levels in male obese individuals correlate with impaired glucose homeostasis. Taken together, these findings identify a complex cellular crosstalk that inhibits adipogenesis and impairs adipose tissue homeostasis.;"Baláz, Miroslav; Balázová, Lucia; Blüher, Matthias; Ding, Lianggong; Dong, Hua; Hamilton, Bradford; Klein, Holger; Klöting, Nora; Löffler, Mona; Neubauer, Heike; Shen, Yang; Sun, Wenfei; Wolfrum, Christian";https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-11104;2022-01-13T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-11104;ArrayExpress;Identification of a regulatory pathway inhibiting adipogenesis via RSPO2;1E093747-8FA2-4A76-BA1F-AC7D7BA0C8C5;191829

According to a statement by Pavel Etingof, in the special case of an affine variety X with a faithful action by a finite group G, the sheaf of (twisted) Cherednik algebras H_{c, \psi} with formal parameters c, \psi is a universal formal deformation of D_X#G where D_X is the sheaf of differential operators on X. In the current note, we generalize Etingof's result to the non-affine case. We prove that for a generic smooth analytic or algebraic variety X, the sheaf H_{c, \psi} with formal c and \psi is a universal filtered formal deformation of D_X#G. To that aim, we first construct quasi-isomorphisms between the Hochschild (co)chain complex of D_X#G and the G-invariant part of the direct sum over all elements g in G of sheaves of holomorphic differential forms on the cotangent bundles of the g-fixed point submanifolds in X. Finally, we combine these quasi-isomorphisms with results from the theory of algebraic extensions for sheaves of filtered associative algebras to establish a bijective correspondence between the space of isomorphism classes of filtered infinitesimal deformations of D_X#G and the parameter space of H_{c, \psi}.;Vitanov, Alexander;" arXiv:2007.01399v2";;https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01399;ARXIV;Sheaves of Twisted Cherednik Algebras as Universal Filtered Formal Deformations;5258ACCA-CEA2-4338-A847-AB5EFD98FC69;188014

In robotics, controlling the stiffness of the joints that contribute to the robots' degree of freedom dictates the adaptability, versatility, and safety of the whole system. We can achieve variable stiffness or impedance in a robotic system purely by the control or by introducing new material or mechanisms to address cases that require innate safety through system compliancy. This paper presents JammJoint, a compliant and flexible wearable robot, which uses jamming of granular media to vary its stiffness. It consists of a silicone sleeve with hollow sections that are filled with cubic rubber granules and subjected to different levels of vacuum pressure. Unlike contemporary vacuum-based actuators or systems, JammJoint is wearable, portable, and autonomous: It uses a powerful miniature vacuum pump, a small battery, and bluetooth-enabled electronics. Experiments revolving around bending and torsional stiffness show that the system is able to achieve up to a fourfold increase in spring stiffness. Further measurements of individual variable stiffness structures indicate that for other modes of deformation, including simply supported bending or compression for alternative linear applications, higher changes in stiffness over a factor of seven are possible.

A variety of reconfigurable surface devices, utilizing large numbers of actuated physical pixels to produce discretized three-dimensional contours, have been developed for different purposes in research and industry. The difficulty of integrating many actuators in close configuration has limited the DOF and resolution and performance of existing devices. Utilizing vacuum power and soft material actuators, we have developed a soft reconfigurable surface (SRS) with multimodal control and performance capabilities. The SRS is comprised of a square grid array of linear vacuum-powered soft pneumatic actuators, built into plug-and-play modules which enable the arrangement, consolidation, and control of many DoF. In addition to the practical benefits of system integration, this architecture facilitates the construction of customized assemblies with an overall compact form factor. A series of experiments is performed to illustrate and validate the versatility of the SRS for achieving diverse tasks including force-controlled modulation of interface pressure through integrated sensors, lateral manipulation of a variety of objects, static and dynamic shape and pattern generation for haptic interaction, and variable surface stiffness tuning. This SRS concept is scalable, space efficient, and features diverse functional potential. This will extend the utility and accessibility of tangible robotic interfaces for future applications from industrial to home and personal use.;"Felt, Wyatt; Murakami, Masato; Paik, Jamie; Robertson, Matthew A.";10.1109/TMECH.2018.2878621;2018-10-29T00:00:00Z;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hWQL-yKM0LSWls-DvB4e1FkyCMnSsHpV;Robertson_TMECH;A Compact Modular Soft Surface With Reconfigurable Shape and Stiffness;83B2EED8-6ACE-4FBE-9F5C-FE17D0D98914;163292
"We obtained time-series of OCT scans reporting the structural development of phototrophic benthic biofilms in a open-channel flume experiment in raw lake water. Growth conditions and materials are reported in the relative publication. OCT scans at two lateral resolutions (40 um, 40 um, 2.18 um x,y,z respectivey) and (11.1 um ,11.1 um and 2.18 um) were taken every 3 days in a 15 days experiment. 66 x 3 low resolution (LR) scans covered an area of 0.4 m x 0.025 m in a tiled pattern. 3 x 3 high resolution (HR) scans were taken at the extremes of the same area of interest. These are labeled as slow-flow morphotype (SFM, or B5) and and fast-flow morphotype (FFM, or B1), to indicate the respective contrasting flow velocity conditions. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Authomated OCT scans acquisition was done with the system descibed in (Depetris et al. 2019, Automated 3D Optical Coherence Tomography to Elucidate Biofilm Morphogenesis Over Large Spatial Scales, JoVE, 10.3791/59356). The 'raw OCT scans' folder contains all the raw OCT scans, as well as some samples of OCT scans corrected for spherical aberrations. OCT scans were processed to obtain a 2D map of the biofilm surface topology, in which each pixel gray-level encodes the biofilm height; these are termed digital elevation models (DEM). DEMs were then stitched in a unique image and stacked into time-series; these are in the 'DEMs' folder. Around day 15, several oxygen concentration depth profiles were measured within and around structures of the SFM and FFM (just for replicate II). The precise positioning of the microsensor respect to the OCT scan was achieved with a precision positioning robot. Profiles were taken mostly in both light and dark conditions; raw profiles are in the ""Profiles"" folder, together with the metadata files containing x,y coordinates respect to the respective OCT scan. 'Tables' contain .csv files with various morphological characterizations that were done on the DEM stacks, as well as output files from the profiles analyses.

AbstractOptical soliton molecules are bound states of solitons that arise from the balance between attractive and repulsive effects. Having been observed in systems ranging from optical fibres to mode-locked lasers, they provide insights into the fundamental interactions between solitons and the underlying dynamics of the nonlinear systems. Here, we enter the multistability regime of a Kerr microresonator to generate superpositions of distinct soliton states that are pumped at the same optical resonance, and report the discovery of heteronuclear dissipative Kerr soliton molecules. Ultrafast electrooptical sampling reveals the tightly short-range bound nature of such soliton molecules, despite comprising cavity solitons of dissimilar amplitudes, durations and carrier frequencies. Besides the significance they hold in resolving soliton dynamics in complex nonlinear systems, such heteronuclear soliton molecules yield coherent frequency combs whose unusual mode structure may find applications in metrology and spectroscopy.;"Bouchand, Romain; Herr, Tobias; Kippenberg, Tobias J.; Lucas, Erwan; Obrzud, Ewelina; Weng, Wenle";10.5281/zenodo.3668714;2020-12-14T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3668714;zenodo;Heteronuclear soliton molecules in optical microresonators;9C13604F-900B-4516-81B1-319F47717FE3;176563
Abstract Due to the slowdown of Moore’s law, it will become increasingly challenging to efficiently scale the network in current data centers utilizing electrical packet switches as data rates grow. Optical circuit switches (OCS) represent an appealing option to overcome this issue by eliminating the need for expensive and power-hungry transceivers and electrical switches in the core of the network. In particular, optical switches based on tunable lasers and arrayed waveguide grating routers are quite promising due to the use of a passive core, which increases fault tolerance and reduces management overhead. Such an OCS-network can offer high bandwidth, low network latency and an energy-efficient and scalable data center network. To support dynamic data center workloads efficiently, however, it is critical to switch between wavelengths at nanosecond (ns) timescales. Here we demonstrate ultrafast OCS based on a microcomb and semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). Using a photonic integrated Si 3 N 4 microcomb, sub-ns (<520 ps) switching along with the 25-Gbps non-return-to-zero (NRZ) and 50-Gbps four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) burst mode data transmission is achieved. Further, we use a photonic integrated circuit comprising an Indium phosphide based SOA array and an arrayed waveguide grating to show sub-ns switching (<900 ps) along with 25-Gbps NRZ burst mode transmission providing a path towards a more scalable and energy-efficient wavelength-switched network for data centers in the post Moore’s Law era.;"Ballani, Hitesh; Behrendt, Raphael; Cletheroe, Daniel; Costa, Paolo; Fu, Xin; Haller, Istvan; Jozwik, Krzysztof; Karinou, Fotini; Karpov, Maxim; Kippenberg, Tobias Jan; Lange, Sophie; Liu, Junqiu; Lukashchuk, Anton; Raja, Arslan Sajid; Shi, Kai; Thomsen, Benn";10.5281/zenodo.4588562;2021-12-15T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4588562;zenodo;Ultrafast optical circuit switching for data centers using integrated soliton microcombs;1F6E0684-DE33-4F31-994E-388F03EA5721;176563

We introduce a vacuum-powered soft pneumatic actuator (V-SPA) that leverages a single, shared vacuum power supply and enables complex soft robotic systems with multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) and diverse functions. In addition to actuation, other utilities enabled by vacuum pressure include gripping and stiffening through granular media jamming, as well as direct suction adhesion to smooth surfaces, for manipulation or vertical fixation. We investigate the performance of the new actuator through direct characterization of a 3-DoF, plug-and-play V-SPA Module built from multiple V-SPAs and demonstrate the integration of different vacuum-enabled capabilities with a continuum-style robot platform outfitted with modular peripheral mechanisms. We show that these different vacuum-powered modules can be combined to achieve a variety of tasks-including multimodal locomotion, object manipulation, and stiffness tuning-to illustrate the utility and viability of vacuum as a singular alternative power source for soft pneumatic robots and not just a peripheral feature in itself. Our results highlight the effectiveness of V-SPAs in providing core soft robot capabilities and facilitating the consolidation of previously disparate subsystems for actuation and various specialized tasks, conducive to improving the compact design efficiency of larger, more complex multifunctional soft robotic systems.A foam-based, vacuum-powered actuator enables a multifunctional soft robotic system.A foam-based, vacuum-powered actuator enables a multifunctional soft robotic system.;"Paik, Jamie; Robertson, Matthew A.";10.1126/scirobotics.aan6357;2017-08-30T00:00:00Z;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P20Z8mmYUWRG7ZyAycW6bPGcgGG4Obdz;Robertson_ScienceRobotics;New soft robots really suck: Vacuum-powered systems empower diverse capabilities;C8A28656-98DA-4CFD-BEA3-00C3E83C431B;163292
This paper presents the concept and model of “Vacuum Bellows,” a cylindrical membrane-reinforced contractile vacuum soft pneumatic actuator (V-SPAs). These actuators consist of a tubular membrane connected to a series of interior rigid rings periodically spaced along its length. Our model shows how the rings can be spaced to achieve a desired actuator force profile. For example, the contraction ratio can be maximized by spacing the rings one diameter apart inside the tube. The work output of the actuator can be concentrated in the initial portion of the stroke by increasing the ring spacing. And, usefully, an approximately constant force-to-pressure relationship can be created by spacing the rings a fraction of a diameter apart. Our experimental results highlight the utility of the model and some practical considerations for actuator fabrication and use. The experimental results demonstrate how the ring spacing can be used to achieve high peak forces per unit pressure (three times greater than an equivalent-diameter piston achieved experimentally) or large contractions (achieved contraction to 30 % of the extended length). Our model suggests that this performance can be improved with improved fabrication techniques.;"Felt, Wyatt; Paik, Jamie; Robertson, Matthew A.";10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2018.8405381;2018-04-01T00:00:00Z;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1evbza7vQyJHx90PaJIVi1MfgpS3TAGJU;Felt_RobosoftConf2018;Modeling vacuum bellows soft pneumatic actuators with optimal mechanical performance;7A1368DC-5C0E-4E19-B10D-3775C7560A70;163292
Wearable soft robotic systems are enabling safer human-robot interaction and are proving to be instrumental for biomedical rehabilitation. In this manuscript, we propose a novel, modular, wearable robotic device for human (lumbar) spine assistance that is developed using vacuum driven, soft pneumatic actuators (V-SPA). The actuators can handle large, repetitive loads efficiently under compression. Computational models to capture the complex non-linear mechanical behavior of individual actuator modules and the integrated assistive device are developed using the finite element method (FEM). The models presented can predict system behavior at large values of mechanical deformations and allow for rapid design iterations. It is shown that a single actuator module can be used to obtain a variety of different motion and force profiles and yield multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) depending on the module loading conditions, resulting in high system versatility and adaptability, and efficient replication of the targeted motion range for the human spinal cord. The efficacy of the finite element model is first validated for a single module using experimental results that include free displacement and blocked-forces. These results are then extended to encompass an extensive investigation of bio-mechanical performance requirements from the module assembly for the human spine-assistive device proposed.;"Agarwal, Gunjan; Paik, Jamie; Robertson, Matthew A.; Sonar, Harshal";10.1038/s41598-017-14220-3;2017-12-31T00:00:00Z;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DzdQnlliDRTi2V3dbYOHptq_jLH8Renw;Agarwal_ScientificReports;Design and Computational Modeling of a Modular, Compliant Robotic Assembly for Human Lumbar Unit and Spinal Cord Assistance;E4870149-DC38-4A14-BF45-107BDB0360F7;163292

Recently developed soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) powered by negative pressure have demonstrated great potential in the future of soft robotics for their high strength, intrinsic safety, low weight, and often simple design. The majority of these limited examples have only provided linear force and motion profiles, however, despite the general prevalence of bending actuators common to positive pressure powered SPAs. The benefits of such bending type SPAs follow from the direct production of moment and angular motion that are highly desirable for diverse robotic applications and activities, which allows more simple design of soft robots with complex motion behavior. Following this motivation, a new vacuum powered bending actuator is developed here as an extension of a previously presented vacuum powered actuator, the V-SPA, which features simple, lightweight material construction and rapid fabrication. Leveraging these attributes, an empirical study of a new Coil V-SPA performance is conducted across a spectrum of eight actuator prototypes. The force, speed, and stiffness of the actuators are characterized, and a generalized design metric, the Geometric Compression Ratio (GCR), is defined to quantify the relationship between physical geometric parameters of Coil V-SPAs. Finally, the results of testing reveal the new low-inertia actuator is capable of high-speed, and high-bandwidth motion, up to 0.97 m/s and 1.59 Hz, respectively.;"Paik, Jamie; Robertson, Matthew A.";10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2018.8405364;2018-04-01T00:00:00Z;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QdcHbokL8biW1cpBc4_z7ZdQkreXsYwl;Robertson_RobosoftConf2018;Low-inertia vacuum-powered soft pneumatic actuator coil characterization and design methodology;B321F2CF-F10F-4644-B069-17B92FE30FBE;163292

RNA-binding proteins are instrumental for post-transcriptional gene regulation, yet transcriptome-wide methods to profile RNA-protein interactions remain technically challenging. We present an improved library preparation strategy for cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) that involves tailing and ligation of cDNA molecules (TLC) for increased sensitivity and efficiency. TLC-CLIP eliminates time-consuming purifications, reduces sample loss, and minimises experimental steps, allowing precise profiling of RNA-protein interactions from limited starting material at nucleotide resolution.We have generated benchmarking libraries for 4 well-studied RNA-binding proteins from 50.000 293T cells in duplicates, including additional control samples comparing different RNase concentrations, additional adapter removal, omitting PAGE purification and profiling of co-purifying fragments from non-crosslinked samples. We further demonstrate the high sensitivity of our protocol by profiling hnRNPc and RBFOX2 from only 10,000 and 1,000 cells.To integrate our CLIP data with functionally relevant site we have performed RNA-Seq in 293T knockout cells for RBFOX2 to identify alternatively spliced exons.;Ernst, Christina;GSE225358;2023-05-10T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE225358;GEO;Efficient and sensitive profiling of RNA-protein interactions using TLC-CLIP;2E3D2895-3E80-4AA4-AF52-DF22703356C2;202048

Abstract Multi-mode waveguides are ubiquitously used in integrated photonics. Although interaction among different spatial waveguide eigenmodes can induce novel nonlinear phenomena, spatial mode interaction is typically undesired. Adiabatic bends, such as Euler bends, have been favoured to suppress spatial mode interaction. Here, we adapt and optimize Euler bends to build compact racetrack microresonators based on ultralow-loss, multi-mode, silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. The racetrack microresonators feature a footprint of only 0.21 mm 2 for 19.8 GHz free spectral range, suitable for tight photonic integration. We quantitatively investigate the suppression of spatial mode interaction in the racetrack microresonators with Euler bends. We show that the low optical loss rate (15.5 MHz) is preserved, on par with the mode interaction strength (25 MHz). This results in an unperturbed microresonator dispersion profile. We further generate a single dissipative Kerr soliton of 19.8 GHz repetition rate without complex laser tuning schemes or auxiliary lasers. The optimized Euler bends and racetrack microresonators can be building blocks for integrated nonlinear photonic systems, as well as linear circuits for programmable processors or photonic quantum computing.;"He, Jijun; Ji, Xinru; Kippenberg, Tobias J.; Liu, Junqiu; Qiu, Zheru; Riemensberger, Johann; Wang, Rui Ning";10.5281/zenodo.5844709;2022-12-07T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5844709;zenodo;Data and code for figures: Compact, spatial-mode-interaction-free, ultralow-loss, nonlinear photonic integrated circuits;EEB1EB55-E14C-4BED-BCF4-38FE3DB3AE60;176563

AbstractThe rapidly maturing integrated Kerr microcombs show significant potential for microwave photonics. Yet, state-of-the-art microcomb-based radiofrequency filters have required programmable pulse shapers, which inevitably increase the system cost, footprint, and complexity. Here, by leveraging the smooth spectral envelope of single solitons, we demonstrate microcomb-based radiofrequency filters free from any additional pulse shaping. More importantly, we achieve all-optical reconfiguration of the radiofrequency filters by exploiting the intrinsically rich soliton configurations. Specifically, we harness the perfect soliton crystals to multiply the comb spacing thereby dividing the filter passband frequencies. Also, the versatile spectral interference patterns of two solitons enable wide reconfigurability of filter passband frequencies, according to their relative azimuthal angles within the round-trip. The proposed schemes demand neither an interferometric setup nor another pulse shaper for filter reconfiguration, providing a simplified synthesis of widely reconfigurable microcomb-based radiofrequency filters.;"Brès, Camille-Sophie; He, Jijun; Hu, Jianqi; Karpov, Maxim; Kippenberg, Tobias J.; Liu, Junqiu; Lukashchuk, Anton; Raja, Arslan S.";10.5281/zenodo.3902646;2020-12-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3902646;zenodo;Reconfigurable radiofrequency filters based on versatile soliton microcombs;10C6B233-348F-4DCF-B80D-C06E6C6ECA74;176563

Abstract The past decade has witnessed major advances in the development and system-level applications of photonic integrated microcombs, that are coherent, broadband optical frequency combs with repetition rates in the millimeter-wave to terahertz domain. Most of these advances are based on harnessing of dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in microresonators with anomalous group velocity dispersion (GVD). However, microcombs can also be generated with normal GVD using localized structures that are referred to as dark pulses, switching waves or platicons. Compared with DKS microcombs that require specific designs and fabrication techniques for dispersion engineering, platicon microcombs can be readily built using CMOS-compatible platforms such as thin-film (i.e., thickness below 300 nm) silicon nitride with normal GVD. Here, we use laser self-injection locking to demonstrate a fully integrated platicon microcomb operating at a microwave K-band repetition rate. A distributed feedback (DFB) laser edge-coupled to a Si 3 N 4 chip is self-injection-locked to a high- Q ( > 10 7 ) microresonator with high confinement waveguides, and directly excites platicons without sophisticated active control. We demonstrate multi-platicon states and switching, perform optical feedback phase study and characterize the phase noise of the K-band platicon repetition rate and the pump laser. Laser self-injection-locked platicons could facilitate the wide adoption of microcombs as a building block in photonic integrated circuits via commercial foundry service.;"Anderson, Miles H.; Bowers, John E.; Chang, Lin; Guo, Joel; He, Jijun; Kippenberg, Tobias J.; Lihachev, Grigory; Liu, Junqiu; Liu, Yang; Wang, Rui Ning; Weng, Wenle";10.5281/zenodo.5809186;2022-12-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5809186;zenodo;Platicon microcomb generation using laser self-injection locking;088E3280-92D9-4906-B1A1-183C00808E04;176563
Abstract Integrated photonics facilitates extensive control over fundamental light-matter interactions in manifold quantum systems including atoms 1 , trapped ions 2,3 , quantum dots 4 and defect centres 5 . Ultrafast electron microscopy has recently made free-electron beams the subject of laser-based quantum manipulation and characterization 6-11 , enabling the observation of free-electron quantum walks 12-14 , attosecond electron pulses 10,15-17 and holographic electromagnetic imaging 18 . Chip-based photonics 19,20 promises unique applications in nanoscale quantum control and sensing but remains to be realized in electron microscopy. Here we merge integrated photonics with electron microscopy, demonstrating coherent phase modulation of a continuous electron beam using a silicon nitride microresonator. The high-finesse ( Q0 ≈ 10 6 ) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching lead to efficient electron-light scattering at extremely low, continuous-wave optical powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial electron state at a cavity-coupled power of only 5.35 microwatts and generate >500 electron energy sidebands for several milliwatts. Moreover, we probe unidirectional intracavity fields with microelectronvolt resolution in electron-energy-gain spectroscopy 21 . The fibre-coupled photonic structures feature single-optical-mode electron-light interaction with full control over the input and output light. This approach establishes a versatile and highly efficient framework for enhanced electron beam control in the context of laser phase plates 22 , beam modulators and continuous-wave attosecond pulse trains 23 , resonantly enhanced spectroscopy 24-26 and dielectric laser acceleration 19,20,27 .

Abstract Low-loss photonic integrated circuits and microresonators have enabled a wide range of applications, such as narrow-linewidth lasers and chip-scale frequency combs. To translate these into a widespread technology, attaining ultralow optical losses with established foundry manufacturing is critical. Recent advances in integrated Si 3 N 4 photonics have shown that ultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered microresonators with quality factors Q > 10 × 10 6 can be attained at die-level throughput. Yet, current fabrication techniques do not have sufficiently high yield and performance for existing and emerging applications, such as integrated travelling-wave parametric amplifiers that require meter-long photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate a fabrication technology that meets all requirements on wafer-level yield, performance and length scale. Photonic microresonators with a mean Q factor exceeding 30 × 10 6 , corresponding to 1.0 dB m −1 optical loss, are obtained over full 4-inch wafers, as determined from a statistical analysis of tens of thousands of optical resonances, and confirmed via cavity ringdown with 19 ns photon storage time. The process operates over large areas with high yield, enabling 1-meter-long spiral waveguides with 2.4 dB m −1 loss in dies of only 5 × 5 mm 2 size. Using a response measurement self-calibrated via the Kerr nonlinearity, we reveal that the intrinsic absorption-limited Q factor of our Si 3 N 4 microresonators can exceed 2 × 10 8 . This absorption loss is sufficiently low such that the Kerr nonlinearity dominates the microresonator’s response even in the audio frequency band.

AbstractSoliton microcombs constitute chip-scale optical frequency combs, and have the potential to impact a myriad of applications from frequency synthesis and telecommunications to astronomy. The demonstration of soliton formation via self-injection locking of the pump laser to the microresonator has significantly relaxed the requirement on the external driving lasers. Yet to date, the nonlinear dynamics of this process has not been fully understood. Here, we develop an original theoretical model of the laser self-injection locking to a nonlinear microresonator, i.e., nonlinear self-injection locking, and construct state-of-the-art hybrid integrated soliton microcombs with electronically detectable repetition rate of 30 GHz and 35 GHz, consisting of a DFB laser butt-coupled to a silicon nitride microresonator chip. We reveal that the microresonator’s Kerr nonlinearity significantly modifies the laser diode behavior and the locking dynamics, forcing laser emission frequency to be red-detuned. A novel technique to study the soliton formation dynamics as well as the repetition rate evolution in real-time uncover non-trivial features of the soliton self-injection locking, including soliton generation at both directions of the diode current sweep. Our findings provide the guidelines to build electrically driven integrated microcomb devices that employ full control of the rich dynamics of laser self-injection locking, key for future deployment of microcombs for system applications.;"Bilenko, Igor A.; Dmitriev, Nikita Yu.; Kippenberg, Tobias J.; Kondratiev, Nikita M.; Lihachev, Grigory V.; Liu, Junqiu; Lobanov, Valery E.; Voloshin, Andrey S.; Weng, Wenle";10.5281/ zenodo.4079515;2021-12-11T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4079515;zenodo;Dynamics of soliton self-injection locking in optical microresonators;E2D8E17D-D787-4739-8B5D-D4D8F154D34E;176563

Low phase noise lasers based on the combination of III-V semiconductors and silicon photonics are well established in the near-infrared spectral regime. Recent advances in the development of low-loss silicon nitride-based photonic integrated resonators have allowed them to outperform bulk external diode and fiber lasers in both phase noise and frequency agility in the 1550 nm-telecommunication window. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a hybrid integrated laser composed of a gallium nitride-based laser diode and a silicon nitride photonic chip-based microresonator operating at record low wavelengths as low as 410 nm in the near-ultraviolet wavelength region suitable for addressing atomic transitions of atoms and ions used in atomic clocks, quantum computing, or for underwater LiDAR. By self-injection locking of the Fabry-Pérot diode laser to a high-Q (0.4 × 10 6 ) photonic integrated microresonator, we reduce the optical phase noise at 461 nm by a factor greater than 100×, limited by the device quality factor and back-reflection.;"Grandjean, Nicolas; Haller, Camille; Johnson, Noble; Kippenberg, Tobias J.; Lihachev, Grigory; Liu, Junqiu; Riemensberger, Johann; Siddharth, Anat; Teepe, Mark; Voloshin, Andrey S.; Wang, Rui Ning; Wunderer, Thomas; Yang, Zhihong";10.1063/5.0081660;2022-04-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0081660;zenodo;Near ultraviolet photonic integrated lasers based on silicon nitride;9418B340-4913-4966-97D0-E0F3ADA7B833;176563

Chip-based frequency combs The realization of optical frequency combs, light sources with precisely spaced frequencies across a broad spectrum of wavelengths, in dielectric microresonators has affected a range of applications from imaging and ranging to precision time keeping and metrology. Xiang et al. demonstrate that the entire system, the laser-pumping system and the comb-generating microresonators, can be combined into an integrated silicon-based platform. Compatibility with foundry fabrication methods will enable this innovation to have a major impact on coherent communications, optical interconnects, and low-noise microwave generation.

However, their efficient excitation via microwave fields is still a challenge. Current methods including nanocontacts and grating couplers require advanced nanofabrication tools which limit the broad usage. Here we report efficient emission and detection of exchange magnons using micron-sized coplanar waveguides (CPWs) into which we integrated ferromagnetic(m) layers. We excited magnons in a broad frequency band with wavelengths λ down to 100 nm propagating over macroscopic distances in thin yttrium iron garnet. Applying time- and spatially resolved Brillouin light scattering as well as micromagnetic simulations we evidence a significant wavelength conversion process near mCPWs via tunable inhomogeneous fields. We argue that optimized mCPWs form microwave-to-magnon transducers providing phase-coherent exchange magnons with  down to below 40 nm. Without any nanofabrication they allow one to harvest the advantages of nanomagnonics by antenna designs exploited in conventional microwave circuits.;"Baumgaertl, Korbinian; Che, Ping; Dubs, Carsten; Grundler, Dirk; Kukolova, Anna";DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3633075;2020-01-31T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3633075#.XnNgaBco_Fx;zenodo;Efficient wavelength conversion of exchange magnons below 100 nm by magnetic coplanar waveguides;5DC5E077-B0EA-481C-96C8-F4AC7E9813DF;171003

"Technologies for crop breeding have become increasingly sophisticated, yet it remains unclear whether these advances are sufficient to meet future demands. A major challenge with current crop selection regimes is that they are often based on individual performance. This tends to select for plants with “selfish” traits, which leads to a yield loss when they compete in high-density stands. In traditional breeding, this well-known “tragedy of the commons” has been addressed by anticipating ideotypes with presumably preferential characteristics. However, this approach is limited to obvious architectural and physiological traits, and it depends on a mechanistic understanding of how these modulate growth and competition. Here, we developed a general and simple method for the discovery of alleles promoting cooperation of plants in stands; it is based on the game-theoretical premise that alleles increasing cooperation incur a cost to the individual but benefit the monoculture group. Testing the approach using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we found a single major effect locus where the rarer allele was associated with increased levels of cooperation and superior monoculture productivity. We show that the allele likely affects a pleiotropic regulator of growth and defense, since it is also associated with reduced root competition but higher race-specific resistance against a specialized parasite. Even though cooperation is considered evolutionarily unstable, conflicting selective forces acting on a pleiotropic gene might thus maintain latent genetic variation for it in nature. Such variation, once identified in a crop, could be rapidly leveraged in modern breeding programs and provide efficient routes to increase yields.";"Grossniklaus, Ueli; Luo, Shan; Messier, Julie; Niklaus, Pascal; Pires, Nuno; Vasseur, Francois; Wuest, Samuel";"10.5281/zenodo.2659735 ";2019-05-21T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org;Zenodo;Data for: Increasing plant group productivity through latent genetic variation for cooperation;32477AF2-98F8-4430-8290-A850C582E8C3;148223

"In January 2020 a social network analysis survey was conducted among forest policy stakeholders (at the organizational level) from the Canton of Lucerne as well as the national level. The aim was to elicit positions relative to a set of policy options currently discussed with respect to carbon mitigation and sequestration services of the forest, i.e. forest management and to establish information and collaboration network relations in order to identify actor coalitions as inspired by the ""actor coalition framework"" approach to policy analysis. Of the 66 questionnaires sent out, 51 were answered (77%).

In April 2020, about 1700 forest owners of the plateau region of the Canton of Berne were invited to participate in a survey (virtually all of them received a conventional paper-pencil questionnaire) about their willingness to provide forest nature conservation measures in their forest to compensate forest clearances that cannot be compensated by afforestation. The questionnaire contained a survey experiment (conjoint analysis) that offered a choice between two options and the status quo in 9 decision-making situations. Of the 607 completed questionnaires that were returned the survey experiment was completed by about 400.;Schulz, Tobias;https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.278;2022-01-26T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/atree-forest-owner-clearances-offsetting;envidat;ATREE forest owners survey about forest clearances offsetting in the forest;C6245273-D4D6-4426-8D46-C6735F5052FA;172388

"Air-sea exchange of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) is not well constrained, even though it is a major component of the global Hg cycle. Lack of Hg0 flux measurements to validate parameterizations of the Hg0 transfer velocity contributes to this uncertainty. We measured the Hg0 flux on the Baltic Sea coast using micrometeorological methods (two gradient-based and relaxed eddy accumulation (REA)) as well as a gas exchange model. We found that coastal waters were typically supersaturated with Hg0 (mean ± 1 = 13.5 ± 3.5 ng m-3; ca. 10 % of total Hg) compared to the atmosphere (1.3 ± 0.2 ng m-3). The Hg0 flux calculated using the gas exchange model ranged from 0.1 - 1.3 ng m-2 h-1 (10th and 90th percentile) over the course of the campaign (May 10 - June 20, 2017) and showed a distinct diel variation. The mean coastal Hg0 fluxes determined with the two gradient-based approaches and REA were 0.3, 0.5 and 0.6 ng m-2 h-1, respectively. In contrast, the mean open sea Hg0 flux measured with REA was larger (6.3 ng m-2 h-1). The open sea Hg0 flux indicated a stronger wind speed dependence for the transfer velocity of Hg0 compared to commonly used parameterizations. Although based on a limited data set, we suggest that the wind speed dependence of the Hg0 transfer velocityis more in line with gases that have a lower water solubility than CO2 (e.g. O2). More land-based Hg0 flux measruements using direct micrometerological methods could significantly improve our understanding of air-sea Hg exchange.";"Bishop, Kevin; Nilsson, Wei; Osterwalder, Stefan; Zhu , Wei";305;2021-03-17T00:00:00Z;https://www.safedeposit.se/projects/305;safedeposit;" Hg Ostergarnsholm";1A4F8702-C4AC-4E4C-A0E9-A95A1A149101;174101

We present stated preference data for improved forest management measures from seven Swiss municipalities in the Cantons of Grisons and Valais. The data was collected between October 2019 and February 2020 using an online questionnaire. We invited 10289 households to participate and received 939 responses. The online questionnaire consisted of two main parts: (i) an online choice experiment and (ii) questions on the sociodemographic characteristics of the responding households. The choice experiment confronted households with twelve consecutive choice tasks. Each choice task consisted of three options with a varying degree of avalanche and rock fall risk reduction due to improved forest management. The options further differed with respect to the way the costs for the improved forest management are allocated and the way they are calculated. We additionally provided each of the options with a cost attribute, allowing for the calculation of willingness to pay measures. At the end of the choice experiment we asked five de-briefing questions and eight attitudinal questions. Additionally, we asked the responding households to state their willingness to take risks. The sociodemographic characteristics collected in the second part of the questionnaire allow for an analysis of the impact they have on the choices we observed in the first part of the questionnaire.;"Olschewski, Roland; Unterberger, Christian";"10.16904/envidat.175 ";2020-10-13T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/stated-preference-data-on-the-insurance-value-of-forests-in-switzerland;ENVIDAT;"Stated preference data on the insurance value of forests in Switzerland ";EDA29899-CB27-4541-8AFE-C7474D8B5D3F;172399

The multimodal dataset VEPCON follows the BIDS standard and provides raw data of high-density EEG, structural MRI and diffusion weighted images (DWI) recorded in 20 participants and derivatives.Visual evoked potentials were recorded while participants discriminated briefly presented faces from scrambled faces, or coherently moving stimuli from incoherent ones. MRI and DWI were recorded in a separate session from the same participants.The dataset contains pre-processed EEG of single trials in each condition, behavioral measures, structural MRIs, individual brain parcellations at 5 spatial resolutions (66 to 998 regions), and corresponding structural connectomes based on fiber count, fiber density, average fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps. In addition, we provide EEG inverse solutions for source imaging based on individual anatomy, and Python and Matlab code for deriving time-series of activity in each brain region, at each parcellation level.This dataset can contribute to multimodal methods development, studying structure-function relations, as well as unimodal optimization of source imaging and graph analysis, among many other possibilities.;Pascucci, David;https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds003505.v1.1.1;;https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003505/versions/1.0.1;OpenNeuro;Vepcon: Source imaging of high-density visual evoked potentials with multi-scale brain parcellations and connectomes;8515369C-11DB-4DE2-988F-911CB9A8274B;179988

"In Novdember 2019 about 19 experts on forest surface protection and forest clearances were invited to a workshop in order to discuss policy design and implementation problems regarding the offsetting of forest clearances. In Switzerland such offsetting can be provided under certain circumstances by implementing forest nature conservation measures in the forest instead of providing in-kind compensation, i.e. reafforestation on agricultural land. The workshop included the sorting of 34 statements - that were elaborated beforehand, partially also with help of the participants - according to the ""Q-methodology"" survey technique (participants arrange given statements about a certain subject into boxes that are normally distributed over a ""agree - do not agree"" answer scale). The participants included representatives from cantonal and national forest administrations, nature conservation NGOs, forest NGOs, spatial planning NGOs, private counseling enterprises as well as national, cantonal and regional forest owner organizations.

"ndustrial Work Assistant, IIWA - KUKA, Augsburg, Germany) to position objects in a large three-dimensional work space and safely interact with primates. The software package is configured as a finite state machine. Specifically, the robot moves the end effector to a set of pre-determined positions in space using standard impedance joint control strategy. When the position is reached, the finite state machine switches to mass-spring damper behaviour. Stiffness and damping parameters are entirely definable by the user and can be easily modified. The three-dimensional pulling force is continuously monitored and recorded. When the end-effector is pulled across a predetermined virtual border, the robot returns to the starting position where it waits for the next target position.

This repository contains files to control with Python the acquisition of OCT scans with a Thorlabs OCT device. This is done with a Python/C API extension for the C++ ThorImage SDK (OctControl.cpp). A file precompiled using ThorImage OCT 4.4.8, Python 3.6 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 is also provided (OctControl.pyd). ThorImage SDK is required.The functions encoded in OctControl.pyd can be used in combination with a GRBL controlled CNC device (see https://gitlab.com/FlumeAutomation/GRBL_Server.git) in order to automatically synchronize precise positioning of the OCT probe and OCT scans acquisition. This also allows to acquire OCT scans in a mosaic pattern or to monitor the same location over extended periods of time.Libraries for OCT scans acquisition in combination with the positioning of the probe (eg mosaic pattern) (ImagesAcquisition.py), correction of spherical aberrations (OctCorrection.py) and height map calculation/stitching (ImageProcessing.py) are provided.Two worked examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks, depict a sample workflow for images acquisition, and images processing starting from a set of sample scans of a biofilm.;Depetris, Anna;?;2019-04-01T00:00:00Z;https://gitlab.com/FlumeAutomation/automated-oct-scans-acquisition;GitLab;Automated OCT scans acquisition  Project ID: 9184880;5E1DC6B6-1D98-4942-AD07-18B27EF8CB6A;159958

The Pandemic Border Discourses project identifies and compares the evolution of discourses restricting internal and external mobility in Europe as the Covid-19 pandemic is unfolding. It is designed to show how political actors use discourses to justify their decisions in emergency situations, and analyse whether and how unforeseen systemic pressure disrupts bordering discourses and practices. It contributes to a better understanding of the political, social and economic issues driving policy decision in times of crisis, above all the tension between national interest and transnational solidarity.This coding manual explains our data collection strategy and introduces the variables of the dataset. Building on a core-sentence analysis method, we collect and analyse institutional discourses about mobility during the Covid-19 crisis on Twitter.;"Bélanger, Marie-Eve; Lavenex, Sandra";10.5281/zenodo.6619705;2022-06-07T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/6619705#.ZEZ7XHZByUl;Zenodo;Pandemic Border Discourses Dataset and Codebook - Swiss Case;C78301B7-9CAE-463B-A95C-5BAB0EFECFC9;196359

"Soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) are found in mobile robots, assistive wearable devices, and rehabilitative technologies. While soft actuators have been one of the most crucial elements of technology leading the development of the soft robotics field, they fall short of force output and bandwidth requirements for many tasks. In addition, other general problems remain open, including robustness, controllability, and repeatability. The SPA-pack architecture presented here aims to satisfy these standards of reliability crucial to the field of soft robotics, while also improving the basic performance capabilities of SPAs by borrowing advantages leveraged ubiquitously in biology; namely, the structured parallel arrangement of lower power actuators to form the basis of a larger and more powerful actuator module. An SPA-pack module consisting of a number of smaller SPAs will be studied using an analytical model and physical prototype. Experimental measurements show an SPA pack to generate over 112 N linear force, while the model indicates the benefit of parallel actuator grouping over a geometrically equivalent single SPA scale as an increasing function of the number of individual actuators in the group. For a module of four actuators, a 23% increase in force production over a volumetrically equivalent single SPA is predicted and validated, while further gains appear possible up to 50%. These findings affirm the advantage of utilizing a fascicle structure for high-performance soft robotic applications over existing monolithic SPA designs. An example of high-performance soft robotic platform will be presented to demonstrate the capability of SPA-pack modules in a complete and functional system.";"Florez, Juan Manuel; Paik, Jamie; Robertson, Matthew A.; Sadeghi, Hamed";10.1089/soro.2016.0029;2017-03-01T00:00:00Z;https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Tk0hNWz2iYvPVpBuvsUUoKIqq5Fu78U;Robertson_SoRo;Soft Pneumatic Actuator Fascicles for High Force and Reliability;F8B94B7E-AFF9-4DBE-B307-DC90F96D16AF;163292
Vacuum-powered Soft Pneumatic Actuator (V-SPA) Modules have been described to afford advantages for rapid development of reconfigurable, multi-DoF soft pneumatic robots powered by vacuum by reducing their logistical complexity, however they also present new challenges in the control of resulting systems. This framework features modules joined together over a simple embedded pneumatic and serial communication network and requires a unique approach to both low-level control implementation and high-level control strategy. We describe the structure and activation characteristics of a V-SPA Module and present practical methods for its control. These methods utilize software generated PWM activation through a unique serial protocol designed for LED networks and a heuristic mapping strategy for simplifying the spherical control of 3-DoF actuator modules.;"Paik, Jamie; Robertson, Matthew A.";10.1109/IROS.2017.8202296;2017-09-01T00:00:00Z;https://drive.google.com/open?id=17MikY6iCtVCmrheh8tdfNyFdsVF41osM;Robertson_IROS2017;Practical control methods for vacuum driven soft actuator modules;18AFAD55-DBD9-4948-9B6E-5D74BA68B225;163292

Supplementary data.Weyl semimetals in three-dimensional crystals provide the paradigm example of topologically protected band nodes. It is usually taken for granted that a pair of colliding Weyl points annihilate whenever they carry opposite chiral charges. In stark contrast, here we report that Weyl points in systems symmetric under the composition of time-reversal with a π-rotation are characterized by a non-Abelian topological invariant. The topological charges of the Weyl points are transformed via braid phase factors which arise upon exchange inside symmetric planes of the reciprocal momentum space. We elucidate this process with an elementary two-dimensional tight-binding model implementable in cold-atoms setups and in photonic systems. In three dimensions, interplay of the non-Abelian topology with point-group symmetry is shown to enable topological phase transitions in which pairs of Weyl points may scatter or convert into nodal-line rings. By combining our theoretical arguments with first-principles calculations, we predict that Weyl points occurring near the Fermi level of zirconium telluride (ZrTe) carry non-trivial values of the non-Abelian charge, and that uniaxial compression strain drives a non-trivial conversion of the Weyl points into nodal lines.;"Bouhon, Adrien; Bzdušek, Tomáš; Slager, Robert-Jan; Weng, Hongming; Wu, QuanSheng; Yazyev, Oleg V.";https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:vb-mk;2020-06-09T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:vb-mk;Materials Cloud;Non-Abelian reciprocal braiding of Weyl points and its manifestation in ZrTe;7CECCC8B-FC6E-46BD-A8C3-1B744D7E25BF;185806

During navigation, animals estimate their position using path integration and landmarks, engaging many brain areas. Whether these areas follow specialized or universal cue integration principles remains incompletely understood. We combine electrophysiology with virtual reality to quantify cue integration across thousands of neurons in three navigation-relevant areas: primary visual (V1), retrosplenial (RSC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). The data contained in this dataset consists of recordings of MEC, RSC or V1, made with Neuropixel probes in mice. Recordings were made while mice performed a simple virtual reality behavior where they had to navigate to run down a virtual hallway to receive a water reward at the end. Detailed description of data below.

It is a plausible hypothesis that parallel adaptation events to the same environmental challenge should result in genetic changes of similar or identical effects, depending on the underlying fitness landscapes. However, systematic testing of this is scarce. Here we examine this hypothesis in two closely related plant species, Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis arenosa, which co-occur at two calamine metalliferous (M) sites harbouring toxic levels of the heavy metals zinc and cadmium. We conduct individual genome resequencing alongside soil elemental analysis for 64 plants from eight populations on M and non-metalliferous (NM) soils, and identify genomic footprints of selection and local adaptation. Selective sweep and environmental association analyses indicate a modest degree of gene as well as functional network convergence, whereby the proximal molecular factors mediating this convergence mostly differ between site pairs and species. Notably, we observe repeated selection on identical single nucleotide polymorphisms in several A. halleri genes at two independently colonized M sites. Our data suggest that species-specific metal handling and other biological features could explain a low degree of convergence between species. The parallel establishment of plant populations on calamine M soils involves convergent evolution, which will probably be more pervasive across sites purposely chosen for maximal similarity in soil composition.;Sailer, Christian;10.5061/dryad.jg30j4v;2019-06-10T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jg30j4v;Dryad;Data from: Convergent evolution in Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis arenosa on calamine metalliferous soils;A6FED715-CD51-4591-BDF5-C4A5E38101A6;158773

"Humoral immune responses require germinal centres (GC) for antibody affinity maturation. Within GC, B-cell proliferation and mutation are segregated from affinity-based positive selection in the dark zone (DZ) and light zone (LZ) substructures, respectively. While IL21 is known to be important in affinity maturation and GC maintenance, here we show it is required for both establishing normal zone representation and preventing the accumulation of cells in G1 cell cycle stage in the GC LZ.Wildtype and IL21 receptor deficient (Il21r-/-) mice were immunized with NP-KLH in alum. Germinal center B cells were extracted from spleens 7 days, 10 days and 14 days after immunization. RNA was extracted and profiled using RNA-seq.

Although there is good evidence that social animals show elaborate cognitive skills to deal with others, there are few reports of animals physically using social agents and their respective responses as means to an end-social tool use. In this case study, we investigated spontaneous and repeated social tool use behavior in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We presented a group of chimpanzees with an apparatus, in which pushing two buttons would release juice from a distantly located fountain. Consequently, any one individual could only either push the buttons or drink from the fountain but never push and drink simultaneously. In this scenario, an adult male attempted to retrieve three other individuals and push them toward the buttons that, if pressed, released juice from the fountain. With this strategy, the social tool user increased his juice intake 10-fold. Interestingly, the strategy was stable over time, which was possibly enabled by playing with the social tools. With over 100 instances, we provide the biggest data set on social tool use recorded among nonhuman animals so far. The repeated use of other individuals as social tools may represent a complex social skill linked to Machiavellian intelligence.;Schweinfurth, Manon;https://doi.org/10.17630/beac8dda-dbf3-4f17-9b3e-260d1a0fde92;2020-05-18T00:00:00Z;https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/spontaneous-social-tool-use-in-a-chimpanzee-dataset(beac8dda-dbf3-4f17-9b3e-260d1a0fde92).html;PURE, St Andrews;"Spontaneous social tool use in a chimpanzee ";93534DE1-96A1-4152-A0D6-744BBACF134C;175269
During navigation, animals estimate their position using path integration and landmarks, engaging many brain areas. Whether these areas follow specialized or universal cue integration principles remains incompletely understood. We combine electrophysiology with virtual reality to quantify cue integration across thousands of neurons in three navigation-relevant areas: primary visual (V1), retrosplenial (RSC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). The data shared here contains receptive field locations of V1 neurons recorded in this study.Receptive_fields: Data from receptive field mapping experiments.

"This data set contains salinity measurements from discrete seawater samples that were collected in the Southern Ocean (south of 30deg S) during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). 657 samples were collected during the period December 24th, 2016 and March 18th, 2017 in the Southern Ocean from the surface ocean using the ship's underway line (UW; 328 samples) and in vertical profiles using Niskin bottles mounted on the CTD rosette (273 samples). A few additional samples (56) were collected from a parallel cast with a trace-metal rosette, with a bucket, and as duplicates to ensure data quality. All samples were analyzed for their salinity and results are reported on the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78; Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., 1989). Measurements were performed on a Guildline Autosal Laboratory Salinometer 8400(B) at CSIRO (Hobart, Australia) for samples collected during leg 1, and on a OPTIMARE Precision Salinometer (OPS) at the Alfred Wegener Institute (Bremerhaven, Germany) for samples collected during legs 2 and 3.

"This data set contains vertical seawater temperature profiles measured by Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) probes that were deployed in the Southern Ocean during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) on board the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov. 40 XBT probes were deployed during legs 2 and 3 of the expedition in the period 25th January, 2017 to 17th March, 2017. The XBT probes are manufactured and distributed by T.S.K./Sippican Tsurumi-Seiki Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan (http://www.tsk-jp.com) and are of the type T-07, which is rated at a ship speed of up to 15 knots. These probes have a measuring time of 123 seconds and maximum measurement depth of about 789 m. Probes were launched from a handheld device from the stern of the ship either on the port or starboard side while the ship was moving. The deck unit recorded the temperature and the time since the probe was launched. This time was then converted to depth using the known fall rate of the probe in seawater and the coefficients provided by the manufacturer (WMO standards; Hanawa et al., 1995). The profiles were corrected for known surface biases (Kizu and Hanawa, 2002; Uehara et al., 2008). We provide the raw data, the data produced by using the coefficients provided by the manufacturer, and a corrected version in which we apply an empirical correction based on a comparison with CTD data (Henry et al., 2019), where XBT profiles were launched alongside the CTD deployment. The data has been quality controlled by comparing it to a number of CTD profiles. Data is provided at full vertical resolution and a 1-m averaged resolution. In addition, we provide derived variables such as surface mixed layer depth (temperature threshold) estimates. We are grateful to the crew of the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov and AARI for donating these probes to our project. Their use-by date had expired, however this was not seen as an issue. This data set provides insights into the hydrography of the Southern Ocean during one austral summer season and complements the CTD temperature profiles measured during ACE by filling in the gaps between CTD stations.";"Haumann, F.

In an immersion incident, a person may be required to tread water for extended periods of time in order to survive. Treading water, or maintaining a stable head position above the water surface, can be achieved in several different ways. Determining which treading water techniques are economic (energetically and cognitively) is an important step in providing evidence-based water safety instruction. Skilled water treaders (n = 21) performed four common treading techniques for 3 minutes each: ‘running’ in the water, ‘flutter kick’ with hands sculling, ‘upright breaststroke’, and ‘egg-beater’. Self-reported rate of perceived exertion and task load, as well as objective measures of probe reaction time, oxygen consumption and heart rate were assessed. The ‘egg-beater’ technique and the ‘upright breaststroke’ technique were linked to significantly lower cognitive and energetic demands compared to the other techniques. Our multidisciplinary analysis shows that in experienced treaders, both the ‘egg-beater’ and the ‘upright breaststroke’ technique are economic techniques when treading water.;van Duijn, Tina;https://osf.io/bruxa/?view_only=ea5c8f5ee0cb44e695649e57264818e2;;https://osf.io/bruxa/?view_only=ea5c8f5ee0cb44e695649e57264818e2;Open Science Framework;Physical and cognitive demands associated with different water treading patterns in experts;76259F35-433D-4F76-A71E-7148CF15A792;187632

SOX2 is part of the core network of transcription factors regulating embryonic stem cell pluripotency. We found that SOX2 has the ability to remain bound to mitotic chromosomes, in contrast to most transcription factors that are excluded from mitotic chromatin as transcription shuts down. We obtained a highly purified population of mitotic mouse embryonic stem cells and compared the genome-wide binding profile of SOX2 to that in asynchronous cells by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), and show that SOX2 remains bound to a small set of genes during mitosis.;Suter , David;GSE89599  ID;2016-11-07T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89599;GEO datasets;Genome-wide analysis of SOX2 binding in asynchronous and mitotic mouse embryonic stem cells.;A9BAA338-9770-4617-9E59-BEA8E1628E4C;144828

This data set contains measurements from various sensors installed on the Aqualine Ferrybox system that was connected to the underway seawater supply in the Southern Ocean during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Data was collected continuously except for periods when the pump of the underway system was switched off or the system was turned off. Data collection covers all three cruise legs in the period 24th December 2016 to 18th March 2017. Data collected with the CTG MiniPack CTD-F are temperature, salinity, pressure, and turbidity. Data collected by the Aanderaa oxygen optode include dissolved oxygen and oxygen saturation. An SBE 18 sensor measured pH. The CTG UniLux fluorometer measured chlorophyll-a concentration. All data has been quality controlled and post-cruise calibrated. Data is provided at 1-minute intervals along the cruise track. In addition, we provide satellite data (sea-surface temperature, sea-surface height, geostrophic velocity, sea-ice concentration) that was interpolated to the cruise-track and an estimate of frontal positions to supplement this underway data set where data was missing or for additional information. This circumpolar data set provides insights into the circumpolar surface ocean conditions and biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean during one austral summer season.Note on version 1.0: The first version of this data set only contains temperature, salinity, pressure, and potential density in the post-processed file, since post-processing and quality control for turbidity, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, and pH have not been finalized. These variables will be added to the post-processed data file in a future release.;"Gerber, Franziska; Haumann, F.

"This data set contains model output data from the regional ocean modelling system (ROMS) that was set up for the Southern Ocean (south of 24 °S; Haumann, 2016) to analyze the effects of changing surface freshwater and momentum fluxes on Southern Ocean water-mass changes over the period 1980 to 2011. All data is provided in NetCDF format. The data set contains 3 sets 40-year long model spin-up, control, and 3 perturbation simulations each. The sets differ by their model mean state to assess the effect of surface salinity biases on the results. One set of simulations are reference simulations where salinity is restored to the observed surface salinity during model spin-up, and the other two sets are simulations in which the restoring surface salinity has been altered by plus and minus 0.1 PSU, respectively. The control and perturbation simulations are 40-year extensions of the respective model spin-up simulations. In the perturbation simulations either the surface freshwater fluxes or momentum fluxes are instantaneously perturbed after the spin-up simulation to reflect the observation-derived changes in these surface fluxes and then held constant (at the perturbed level) for 40 years. They consist of sea-ice freshwater flux, glacial meltwater flux, and atmosphere-ocean momentum flux changes. Details on the model setup, forcing, and simulations can be obtained from the related research article by Haumann et al. (2020; https://doi.org/10.1029/2019AV000132).";"Gruber, Nicolas; Haumann, F.

Density reversal of senescent red blood cells (RBCs) has been known for more than ten years, yet the identity of the candidate protein(s) is still elusive. While performing Percoll density gradient separation of RBCs from healthy individuals and their subsequent characterization, we identified a fraction of cells in the low-density fraction (~0.025% compared to total RBCs population) which shows reversal in their densities along with the characteristics of cellular senescence such as loss of membrane Band 3 protein and the phosphatidylserine exposure to the outer membrane leaflet. Our subsequent analysis showed that these cells are overloaded with Ca2+. We further measured intracellular [Na+] in individual RBCs by flow cytometry utilizing the dye CoroNa Green-AM.  Our findings showed that the cells with senescent characteristics lost their transmembrane Na+ gradient despite maintaining the membrane integrity. Consequently, these findings lead us to designate these cells as “senescent-like” cells. Our data further demonstrated altered activities of nonselective cation channels and pumps in these cells. In addition to a facilitated Na+ extrusion by Na+, K+-ATPase, our findings indicated altered ion transport via Piezo1 in these cells. Pharmacological modulation of Piezo1 with Yoda1/GsMTx4 showed that Piezo1 and, possibly, other nonselective cation channels by promiscuously transporting Na+ and Ca2+ play an important role in producing these low density “senescent like” cells.;Bogdanova, Anna;10.5281/zenodo.5839743;2022-01-12T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/5839743#.Yd6Kg_7MLZ8;Zenodo;Terminal density reversal and the role of Ca2+ in red blood cells clearance of healthy individuals;166BA947-BB3F-4000-8693-064EA66205C1;180234

We studied the metabolization of taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G), a sesquiterpene lactone of the common dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ) that deters its major root herbivore, the common cockchafer larva ( Melolontha melolontha ). We have demonstrated that TA-G is rapidly deglucosylated and conjugated to glutathione in the insect gut. A broad-spectrum M. melolontha β-glucosidase, Mm_bGlc17, is sufficient and necessary for TA-G deglucosylation. Using cross-species RNA interference, we have shown that Mm_bGlc17 reduces TA-G toxicity. Furthermore, Mm_bGlc17 is required for the preference of M. melolontha larvae for TA-G-deficient plants. Thus, herbivore metabolism modulates both the toxicity and deterrence of a plant defense compound. Our work illustrates the multifaceted roles of insect digestive enzymes as mediators of plant-herbivore interactions.;"Bont, Zoe; Erb, Matthias; Fricke, Julia; Gablenz, Saskia; Gershenzon, Jonathan; Hu, Lingfei; Huang, Wei; Huber, Meret; Irmisch, Sandra; Liechti, Nicole; Meng, Ye; Paetz, Christian; Rahfeld, Peter; Reichelt, Michael; Riedel, Alexander; Robert, Christelle AM; Roder, Thomas";PRJNA728510;2021-10-11T00:00:00Z;https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA728510?reviewer=nalr50d9a4un536s88pg9h8pfh;Small read archive;A beta-glucosidase of an insect herbivore determines both toxicity and deterrence of a dandelion defense metabolite;6A26702F-928A-4DF4-A721-BCA7E688DE96;186770
Abstract The bacterial division apparatus catalyses the synthesis and remodelling of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) to build the cell wall layer that fortifies the daughter cell poles. Understanding of this essential process has been limited by the lack of native three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli . We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the septal architecture and mode of division can be modified to more closely resemble that of other Gram-negative ( Caulobacter crescentus ) or Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria, suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the formation of different septal morphologies. Finally, analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation (Δ envC Δ nlpD ) showed that cell wall remodelling affects the placement and stability of the cytokinetic ring. Taken together, our results support a model in which competition between the cell elongation and division machineries determines the shape of cell constrictions and the poles they form. They also highlight how the activity of the division system can be modulated to help generate the diverse array of shapes observed in the bacterial domain.;"Allolio, Christoph; Ananda, Virly Y.; Bernhardt, Thomas G.; Chao, Luke H.; Llopis, Paula Montero; Navarro, Paula P.; Vettiger, Andrea";EMD-27486;2022-10-12T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-27486;EMDB;Cryo-electron tomography of Cryo-FIB milled E. coli ftsL* strain;BAB5BB29-B20D-4D69-8657-D6B5DE2B50EF;199252

AbstractMammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) are responsible for the establishment of cell-type-specific DNA methylation in healthy and diseased tissues. Through genome-wide analysis of de novo methylation activity in murine stem cells we uncover that DNMT3A prefers to methylate CpGs followed by cytosines or thymines, while DNMT3B predominantly methylates CpGs followed by guanines or adenines. These signatures are further observed at non-CpG sites, resembling methylation context observed in specialised cell types, including neurons and oocytes. We further show that these preferences result from structural differences in the catalytic domains of the two de novo DNMTs and are not a consequence of differential recruitment to the genome. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that, in case of human DNMT3A, the preference is due to favourable polar interactions between the flexible Arg836 side chain and the guanine that base-pairs with the cytosine following the CpG. By exchanging arginine to a lysine, the corresponding side chain in DNMT3B, the sequence preference is reversed, confirming the requirement for arginine at this position. This context-dependent enzymatic activity provides additional insights into the complex regulation of DNA methylation patterns.;"Baubec, Tuncay; Butz, Stefan; Caflisch, Amedeo; Ilie, Ioana Mariuca; Karemaker, Ino Dominiek; Mallona, Izaskun; Manzo, Massimiliano";10.1093/nar/gkaa1168;2020-11-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE151992;Gene Expression Omnibus;Flanking sequence preference modulates de novo DNA methylation in the mouse genome;F6777F33-23B6-4F52-AF13-62E2E788A957;183722

"Arabidopsis encodes ten ARGONAUTE (AGO) effectors of RNA silencing, canonically loaded with either 21-22nt small RNAs (sRNA) to mediate post-transcriptional-gene-silencing (PTGS) or 24nt sRNAs to promote RNA-directed-DNA-methylation. Using full-locus constructs, we characterized the expression, biochemical properties, and possible modes of action of AGO3. Although AGO3 arose from a recent duplication at the AGO2 locus, their expression differs drastically, with AGO3 prevailing in aerial vascular terminations and specifically in chalazal seed integuments; accordingly, AGO3 down-regulation alters gene expression in siliques. Similar to AGO2, AGO3 binds sRNAs with a strong 5’-adenosine bias, but unlike most Arabidopsis AGOs - AGO2 included - it binds efficiently both 24nt and 21nt sRNAs. AGO3 immuno precipitation experiments in siliques revealed that these sRNAs mostly associate to genes and intergenic regions and not to canonical AGO targets, such as transposable elements. AGO3 localizes to the cytoplasm and co-fractionates with polysomes to possibly mediate PTGS via translation inhibition.";"Bonnet, Diane M.

Abiotic conditions have long been considered essential in structuring freshwater macroinvertebrate communities. Ecological drift, dispersal, and biotic interactions also structure communities, and although these mechanisms are more difficult to detect, they may be of equal importance in natural communities. Here, we hypothesized that in ten naturally-replicated headwater streams in Eastern Switzerland, locally-dominant amphipod species would be associated with differences in environmental conditions. We conducted repeated surveys of amphipods and used a hierarchical joint species distribution model to assess the influence of different drivers on species co-occurrences. The species had unique environmental requirements, but a distinct spatial structure in their distributions was unrelated to habitat. Species co-occurred much less frequently than predicted by the model, which was surprising because laboratory and field evidence suggests they are capable of coexisting in equal densities. We suggest that niche preemption may limit their distribution and that a blocking effect related to the specific linear configuration of streams determines which species colonizes and dominates a given stream catchment, thus suggesting a new solution a long-standing conundrum in freshwater ecology.;"Altermatt, Florian; Little, Chelsea J.";10.5061/dryad.75jq1;2018-03-26T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.75jq1;Dryad;Do priority effects outweigh environmental filtering in a guild of dominant freshwater macroinvertebrates?;3D3B4581-7E65-47A3-B61C-D78B44582EAB;179089
At species’ range edges, individuals often face novel environmental conditions that may limit range expansion until populations adapt. The potential to adapt depends on genetic variation upon which selection can act. However, populations at species’ range edges are often genetically depauperate. One mechanism increasing genetic variation is reshuffling existing variation through sex. Sex, however, can potentially limit adaptation by breaking up existing beneficial allele combinations (recombination load). The gene swamping hypothesis predicts this is specifically the case when populations expand along an abiotic gradient and asymmetric dispersal leads to numerous maladapted dispersers from the range core swamping the range edge. We used the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila as a model for testing the gene swamping hypothesis. We performed replicated range expansions in landscapes with or without a pH-gradient, while simultaneously manipulating the occurrence of gene flow and sexual versus asexual reproduction. We show that sex accelerated evolution of local adaptation in the absence of gene flow, but hindered it in the presence of gene flow. However, sex affected adaptation independently of the pH-gradient, indicating that both abiotic gradients and the biotic gradient in population density lead to gene swamping. Overall, our results show that gene swamping alters adaptation in life-history strategies.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Moerman, Felix; Wagner, Andreas";0000-0002-4831-6958;2020-06-17T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6wwpzgmtk;Dryad;Gene swamping alters evolution during range expansions in the protist Tetrahymena thermophila;6D1E1DCC-A359-49DC-8F1D-D56E84267827;179089
Groundwater belongs to the spatially most extensive, but least explored freshwater systems. On a global scale, the species richness of several subterranean invertebrate taxa parallels species richness found in surface waters, while on a local scale species richness hardly exceeds 20 species. This results in a high contribution of groundwater ecosystems to regional β- and γ-diversity, and to a smaller degree to α-diversity, and deserves focused attention. In general, more species are to be found in large cave systems. The second largest cave system in Europe is Hölloch in Switzerland. In this paper we revised the taxonomic, phylogenetic and ecological diversity of the amphipod community in the Hölloch cave system. While previous records listed five geographically widespread species of the genus Niphargus for this cave system, we could not confirm the presence of any of those species, but rather found three highly distinct species new to science. In this paper we describe Niphargus styx sp. nov., Niphargus murimali sp. nov., and Niphargus muotae sp. nov., and suggest that previous records from that cave were probably misidentifications. Although amphipod species richness in this cave system seems to be lower than previously thought in terms of absolute numbers, the cave retained its regional and international importance in terms of nature conservation for multiple reasons. First, all newly described species are probably endemic to this cave system. Second, they are phylogenetically distantly related and exhibit moderate to high phylogenetic diversity. Third, the species, as inferred from their functional morphology, are also ecologically highly divergent. Based on geographic distribution of their nearest relatives, we hypothesize that the cave system was most likely independently colonized from North, West and South and that the pre-adapted ancestors occupied different ecological niches within the system.;"Altermatt, Florian; Alther, Roman; FiŠer, Cene; Konec, Marjeta; Švara, Vid";10.5061/dryad.pp176;2017-09-30T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pp176;Dryad;Taxonomic, phylogenetic and ecological diversity of Niphargus (Amphipoda: Crustacea) in the Hölloch cave system (Switzerland);A53CB6DD-D12D-489A-B0A3-E18AABF68A01;179089

This project’s aim was to compare the transcriptional profiles of olfactory sensory neurons in Drosophila melanogaster in order to identify novel genes that specify neuron-specific functions/phenotypes or may otherwise be involved in the development of the olfactory system. The isolation of sufficient numbers of intact olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) from the antenna of Drosophila melanogaster has so far limited single-cell transcriptomic approaches being applied to the adult fly antenna. Targeted DamID (TaDa) provides an alternative approach for profiling transcriptional activity in a cell-specific manor that bypasses the need for isolating OSN. Using the Gal4/UAS system, we applied TaDa to seven OSN populations and compared differences in Pol II occupancy for genes across these datasets.;"Abuin, Liliane; Arguello, J.

Landscape connectivity structure, specifically the dendritic network structure of rivers, is expected to influence community diversity dynamics by altering dispersal patterns, and subsequently the unfolding of species interactions. However, previous comparative and experimental work on dendritic metacommunities has studied diversity mostly from an equilibrium perspective. Here we investigated the effect of dendritic versus linear network structure on local (α-diversity), among (β-diversity) and total (γ-diversity) temporal species community diversity dynamics. Using a combination of microcosm experiments, which allowed for active dispersal of 14 protists and a rotifer species, and numerical analyses, we demonstrate the general importance of spatial network configuration and basic life history tradeoffs as driving factors of different diversity patterns in linear and dendritic systems. We experimentally found that community diversity patterns were shaped by the interaction of dispersal within the networks and local species interactions. Specifically, α-diversity remained higher in dendritic networks over time, especially at highly connected sites. β-diversity was initially greater in linear networks, due to increased dispersal limitation, but became more similar to β-diversity in dendritic networks over time. Comparing the experimental results with a neutral metacommunity model we found that dispersal and network connectivity alone may, to a large extent, explain α- and β-diversity dynamics. However, additional mechanisms, such as variation in carrying capacity and competition-colonization tradeoffs, were needed in the model to capture the detailed temporal diversity dynamics of the experiments, such as a general decline in γ-diversity and long-term dynamics in α-diversity.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Seymour, Mathew";10.5061/dryad.1kf36;2016-06-23T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1kf36;Dryad;Dendritic network structure and dispersal affect temporal dynamics of diversity and species persistence;694BE404-7763-4F44-8204-BD8A27DA757C;179089
Dispersal and the underlying movement behaviour are processes of pivotal importance for understanding and predicting metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics. Generally, dispersal decisions are condition-dependent and rely on information in the broad sense, like the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard condition-dependence. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is condition-dependent and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement depend on and are adjusted by the strength of interspecific interactions. We found that the predicting movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and interspecific interaction strengths. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking interspecific interactions into account are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of condition-dependence for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability and the coexistence and distribution of species.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Klecka, Jan; Melián, Carlos J.";10.5061/dryad.nj957;2016-06-23T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.nj957;Dryad;Condition-dependent movement and dispersal in experimental metacommunities;3F0EEB8B-E690-428E-A645-BB9E25CE30C4;179089
Environmental DNA (eDNA) is used to detect biodiversity by the capture, extraction, and identification of DNA shed to the environment. However, eDNA capture and extraction protocols vary widely across studies. This use of different protocols potentially biases detection results and could significantly hinder a reliable use of eDNA to detect biodiversity. We tested whether choice of eDNA capture and extraction protocols significantly influenced biodiversity detection in aquatic systems. We sampled lake and river water, captured and extracted eDNA using six combinations of different protocols with replication, and tested for the detection of four macroinvertebrate species. Additionally, using the same lake water technical replicates, we compared the effect of capture and extraction protocols on metabarcode detections of biodiversity using 16S for eubacteria and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) for eukaryotes. Protocol combinations for capture and extraction of eDNA significantly influenced DNA yield and number of sequences obtained from next generation sequencing. We found significantly different detection rates of species ranging from zero percent to thirty-three percent. Differences in which protocol combinations produced the highest metabarcoded biodiversity were detected and demonstrate that different protocols are required for different biodiversity targets. Our results highlight that the choice of molecular protocols used for capture and extraction of eDNA from water can strongly affect biodiversity detection. Consideration of biases caused by choice of protocols should lead to a more consistent and reliable molecular workflow for repeatable and increased detection of biodiversity in aquatic communities.;"Altermatt, Florian; Deiner, Kristy; Mächler, Elvira; Walser, Jean-Claude";10.5061/dryad.7q19c;2015-11-18T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.7q19c;Dryad;Choice of capture and extraction methods affect detection of freshwater biodiversity from environmental DNA;2F8CF685-0E96-4C42-BC13-BFC982AF2832;179089

Abstract The bacterial division apparatus catalyses the synthesis and remodelling of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) to build the cell wall layer that fortifies the daughter cell poles. Understanding of this essential process has been limited by the lack of native three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli . We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the septal architecture and mode of division can be modified to more closely resemble that of other Gram-negative ( Caulobacter crescentus ) or Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria, suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the formation of different septal morphologies. Finally, analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation (Δ envC Δ nlpD ) showed that cell wall remodelling affects the placement and stability of the cytokinetic ring. Taken together, our results support a model in which competition between the cell elongation and division machineries determines the shape of cell constrictions and the poles they form. They also highlight how the activity of the division system can be modulated to help generate the diverse array of shapes observed in the bacterial domain.;"Allolio, Christoph; Ananda, Virly Y.; Bernhardt, Thomas G.; Chao, Luke H.; Llopis, Paula Montero; Navarro, Paula P.; Vettiger, Andrea";EMD-27485;2022-10-12T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-27485;EMDB;Cryo-electron tomogram of cryo-FIB milled E. coli with deletion of envC and nlpD.

The paper describes an approach to disentangle the recorded transmission spectrum obtained from Bragg edge imaging. The transmission spectrum of the samples embedded in their corresponding powder was successfully extracted, proven by the coinciding strain maps produced. The horizontal profiles from the maps were plotted together with neutron diffraction results and they agree very well. The uploaded data were the raw data obtained from Bragg edge imaging and neutron diffraction experiments used to construct the strain maps and plots shown in the paper.;"Busi, Matteo; Esmaeilzadeh, Reza; Logé, Roland; Malamud, Florencia; Navarre, Claire; Polatidis, Efthymios; Strobl, Markus; Sumarli, Shieren";https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7446594;2022-11-11T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7446594;Zenodo;Neutron Bragg edge imaging for strain characterization in powder bed additive manufacturing environments;9EEC4917-ECD2-412D-BF0A-87917CA7C914;193799
"Two different heat-transport mechanisms are discussed in solids: in crystals, heat carriers propagate and scatter like particles, as described by Peierls' formulation of Boltzmann transport equation for phonon wavepackets; in glasses, instead, carriers behave wave-like, diffusing via a Zener-like tunneling between quasi-degenerate vibrational eigenstates, as described by the Allen-Feldman equation. Recently, it has been shown that these two conduction mechanisms emerge as limiting cases from a unified transport equation, which describes on an equal footing solids ranging from crystals to glasses; moreover, in materials with intermediate characteristics the two conduction mechanisms coexist, and it is crucial to account for both. Here, we discuss the theoretical foundations of such transport equation as is derived from the Wigner phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics, elucidating how the interplay between disorder, anharmonicity, and the quantum Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibrations determines thermal conductivity. This Wigner formulation argues for a preferential phase convention for the dynamical matrix in the reciprocal Bloch representation and related off-diagonal velocity operator's elements; such convention is the only one yielding a conductivity which is invariant with respect to the non-unique choice of the crystal's unit cell and is size-consistent. We rationalize the conditions determining the crossover from particle-like to wave-like heat conduction, showing that phonons below the Ioffe-Regel limit (i.e. with a mean free path shorter than the interatomic spacing) contribute to heat transport due to their wave-like capability to interfere and tunnel. Finally, we show that the present approach overcomes the failures of the Peierls-Boltzmann formulation for materials with ultralow or glass-like thermal conductivity, with case studies of materials for thermal barrier coatings and thermoelectric energy conversion. Here, we release the crystal structures, interatomic force constants, and computational parameters needed to reproduce the results discussed in the article ""Wigner formulation of thermal transport in solids"" (arXiv preprint, 2021) by M. Simoncelli, N. Marzari, and F.

The multimodal treatment of breast cancer may induce long term effects on the metabolic profile and increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease. In this study, we characterized longitudinal changes in serum lipoprotein subfractions and metabolites after breast cancer treatment, aiming to determine the long-term effect of different treatment modalities. Further, we investigated the prognostic value of treatment-induced changes in breast cancer-specific and overall 10-year survival. In this study, serum samples from breast cancer patients (n = 250) were collected repeatedly before and after radiotherapy, and serum metabolites and lipoprotein subfractions were quantified by NMR spectroscopy. Longitudinal changes were assessed by univariate and multivariate data analysis methods applicable for repeated measures. Distinct changes were detectable in levels of lipoprotein subfractions and circulating metabolites during the first year, with similar changes despite large differences in treatment regimens. We detect increased free cholesterol and decreased esterified cholesterol levels of HDL subfractions, a switch towards larger LDL particles and higher total LDL-cholesterol, in addition to a switch in the glutamine-glutamate ratio. Non-survivors had different lipid profiles from survivors already at baseline. To conclude, our results show development towards an atherogenic lipid profile in breast cancer patients with different treatment regimens.;"Andreassen, Trygve; Bathen, Tone F.; Giskeødegård, Guro F.; Lundgren, Steinar; Madssen, Torfinn S.; Reidunsdatter, Randi J.; Sangermani, Matteo; Wethal, Torgeir";https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2022.91952;2022-06-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4068.;EMBL-EBI MetaboLights database (58) with the identifier MTBLS4068;Longitudinal Changes in Circulating Metabolites and Lipoproteins After Breast Cancer Treatment;8174057A-1090-44FA-AB4E-9351E9CA5E52;194492

"Data and code for ""Rage against the Machines"" by Caprettini and VothCan new technology cause social instability and unrest? We examine the famous ""Captain Swing"" riots in 1830s England. Newly-collected data on threshing machine diffusion shows that labor-saving technology was associated with more riots. We instrument technology adoption with the share of heavy soils in a parish: IV estimates demonstrate that threshing machines were an important cause of unrest. Where alternative employment opportunities softened the blow of new technology, there was less rioting. Conversely, where enclosures had impoverished workers, the effect of threshing machines on rioting was amplified.";"Caprettini, Bruno; Voth, Hans-Joachim";http://doi.org/10.3886/E117044V1;2020-11-01T00:00:00Z;http://doi.org/10.3886/E117044V1;OPEN ICPSR;"Data and Code for: ""Rage Against the Machines: Labor-Saving Technology and Unrest in Industrializing England.""";ECEB888A-6E10-4193-A154-988C537B66FA;173998

We describe here a collection of speech data of bilingual and trilingual speakers of English, French, German and Ital- ian. In the context of speech to speech translation (S2ST), this database is designed for several purposes and studies: train- ing CLSA systems (cross-language speaker adaptation), con- veying emphasis through S2ST systems, and evaluating TTS systems. More precisely, 36 speakers judged as accentless (22 bilingual and 14 trilingual speakers) were recorded for a set of 171 prompts in two or three languages, amounting to a to- tal of 24 hours of speech. These sets of prompts include 100 sentences from news, 25 sentences from Europarl, the same 25 sentences with one acted emphasised word, 20 semantically un- predictable sentences, and finally a 240-word long text. All in all, it yielded 64 bilingual session pairs of the six possible com- binations of the four languages. The database is freely available for non-commercial use and scientific research purposes.;Goldman, Jean-Philippe;http://bit.ly/siwisData;2016-11-16T00:00:00Z;http://bit.ly/siwisData;University of Geneva;The SIWIS database;EBCDAB06-C860-4989-A762-3A9D844A32BF;141903

Ambitious initiatives to coordinate genome sequencing of Earth’s biodiversity mean that the accumulation of genomic data is growing rapidly. In addition to cataloguing biodiversity, these data provide the basis for understanding biological function and evolution. Accurate and complete genome assemblies offer a comprehensive and reliable foundation upon which to advance our understanding of organismal biology at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. However, ever-changing sequencing technologies and analysis methods mean that available data are often heterogeneous in quality. In order to guide forthcoming genome generation efforts and promote efficient prioritisation of resources, it is thus essential to define and monitor taxonomic coverage and quality of the data.Here we present an automated analysis workflow that surveys genome assemblies from the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), assesses their completeness using the relevant Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologue (BUSCO) datasets, and collates the results into an interactively browsable resource. We apply our workflow to produce a community resource of available assemblies from the phylum Arthropoda, the Arthropoda Assembly Assessment Catalogue. Using this resource, we survey current taxonomic coverage and assembly quality at the NCBI, we examine how key assembly metrics relate to gene content completeness, and we compare results from using different BUSCO lineage datasets.These results demonstrate how the workflow can be used to build a community resource that enables large-scale assessments to survey species coverage and data quality of available genome assemblies, and to guide prioritisations for ongoing and future sampling, sequencing, and genome generation initiatives.;"Feron, Romain; Waterhouse, Robert";10.5524/100974;2022-01-05T00:00:00Z;http://gigadb.org/dataset/100974;GigaDB;"Supporting data for ""Assessing species coverage and assembly quality of rapidly accumulating sequenced genomes""";8A2545BB-9B0A-4616-9F90-E1D074B6223E;202669

The generation of myotubes from fibroblasts upon forced MyoD expression is a classic example of factor-induced reprogramming in mammals. We recently discovered that additional modulation of signaling pathways with small molecules facilitates reprogramming to more primitive induced muscle progenitor cells (iMPCs). However, the mechanisms by which a single transcription factor drives differentiated cells into distinct developmental states remain unknown. We therefore dissected the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of fibroblasts undergoing MyoD-dependent reprogramming to either myotubes or iMPCs using a novel MyoD transgenic model. To this end, we performed single cell RNA sequencing for Pax7-nGFP positive iMPCs/satellite cells and cells undergoing dedifferentiation (i.e. Dox+FRG) or transdifferentiation (i.e. Dox) Our analyses elucidate the role of MyoD in myogenic reprogramming and derive general principles by which transcription factors and signaling pathways cooperate to rewire cell identity. Our results may also inform on potential therapeutic applications of direct reprogramming.;"Cristea, Simona; Hochedlinger, Konrad; Michor, Franziska; Yagi, Masaki";GSE171039;2022-03-29T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE171039;GEO;Dissecting mechanisms by which MyoD and small molecules convert fibroblasts to muscle progenitor cells;56AB46E7-C456-497E-9E2E-A6B7A53FC6BC;183830

Reference anatomies of the brain and corresponding atlases play a central role in experimental neuroimaging workflows and are the foundation for reporting standardized results. The choice of such references -i.e., templates- and atlases is one relevant source of methodological variability across studies, which has recently been brought to attention as an important challenge to reproducibility in neuroscience. TemplateFlow is a publicly available framework for human and nonhuman brain models. The framework combines an open database with software for access, management, and vetting, allowing scientists to distribute their resources under FAIR -findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable- principles. TemplateFlow supports a multifaceted insight into brains across species, and enables multiverse analyses testing whether results generalize across standard references, scales, and in the long term, species, thereby contributing to increasing the reliability of neuroimaging results.Please visit www.templateflow.org for a more comprehensive description of this project. News and some discussions take place at the Nipy discourse platform [https://nipy.discourse.group/c/nipreps/9].## VisionThe rationale behind TemplateFlow and how we envision it as a fundamental instrument to neuroimaging studies is presented in our preprint:    Ciric R. et al., 2021. doi:10.1101/2021.02.10.430678;"Esteban, Oscar; et al.,";RRID:SCR_021876;2021-01-10T00:00:00Z;https://templateflow.org;TemplateFlow;The TemplateFlow Archive;0D734E71-3C82-40EB-B265-CB3C444C7C43;185872

The Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) has been publishing in black letter from its very first issue in 1780 until 1947. From this time period, we randomly sampled one frontpage per year, resulting in a total of 167 pages. We chose frontpages because they typically contain highly relevant material and because we want to make sure not to sample pages containing exclusively advertisements or stock information. During certain periods, the NZZ was published several times a day, and there were supplements, too. Due to incomplete metadata, the sampling included frontpages from supplements.We then manually corrected the pages, so it can be used as a ground truth to improve the OCR of black letter in historical newspapers.;"Clematide, Simon; Ströbel, Phillip";10.5281/zenodo.3333627;2019-07-12T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3333627;Zenodo;Ground truth for Neue Zürcher Zeitung black letter period;080FB910-1D34-46D5-BB49-5CFDEB62CA15;173719

The Covid-19 outbreak has triggered a global crisis that is challenging governments, health systems and the scientific community worldwide. A central question in the Covid-19 pandemic is whether climatic factors have influenced its progression. To address this question, we used mortality rates during the first three weeks of recorded mortality in 144 countries, during the first wave of the pandemic. We examined the effect of climatic variables, along with the proportion of the population older than 64 years old, the number of beds in hospitals, and the timing and strength of the governmental travel measures to control the spread of the disease. Our first model focuses on air temperature as the central climatic factor and explains 67% of the variation in mortality rate, with 37% explained by the fixed variables considered and 31% explained by country-specific variations. We show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature. Each additional Celsius degree decreases mortality rate by ~5%. Our second model is centred on the UV Index and follows the same trend as air temperature, explaining 69% of the variation in mortality rate. These results are robust to the exclusion of countries with low incomes, as well as to the exclusion of low- and medium-income countries. We also show that the proportion of vulnerable age classes and access to healthcare are critical factors impacting the mortality rate of this disease. The effects of air temperature at an early stage of the Covid-19 outbreak is a key factor to understand the primary spread of this pandemic, and should be considered in projecting subsequent waves.;"Currat, Mathias; Montoya-Burgos, Juan; Quilodrán, Claudio";10.5061/dryad.1ns1rn8th.;2021-06-15T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1ns1rn8th;Dryad;Air temperature influences early Covid-19 outbreak as indicated by worldwide mortality;E0C6E4DF-D76A-4120-83D0-58DB8440846C;183930

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of gastrointestinal vagal deafferentation on gene expression in two brain areas related to anxiety-like behavior (the central nucleus of the amygdala CeA and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis). For this, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=8, 9 weeks of age) were injected blaterally into the nodose ganglia with saporin (SAP) or cholecystokinin cojugated with SAP (CCK-SAP) to induce gastrointestinal vagal deafferentation as previously described (Diepenbroek et al., Am J Physiol, 2015). After a battery of tests investigating anxiety-like behavior (open field, elevated plus maze, acoustic startle reflex and food neophobia) and a verification of the functionality of the neuronal lesion (attentuated anorexigenic response to ip CCK), rats were sacrificed at 30 weeks of age. After anesthesia, rats were perfused for 3 min with oxygenated aCSF and their brains were immediately extracted and frozen in ice cold isopentane. Brain micropunches of CeA and BnST were collected in a cryostat and total RNA extracted with Trizol. Before RNA sequencing, the integrity of mRNA from brain micropunches was verified using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) above 8 were further processed and included in the analysis. RNA sequencing was performed by Novogene.;KRIEGER, Jean-Philippe;PRJEB48979;2022-09-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB48979;European Nucleotide Archive;"RNAsequencing data: Transcriptomic modulation of CeA and BnST following gastrointestinal vagal deafferentation in male rats ";D5C68791-C0B5-40A0-871E-21EA8ED02183;183899

"Abstract: Epilepsy is a major disorder affecting millions of people. While modern electrophysiological and imaging approaches provide high resolution access to the multi-scale brain circuit malfunctions in epilepsy, our understanding of how behavior changes with epilepsy has remained rudimentary. As a result, screening for new therapies for children and adults with devastating epilepsies still relies on the inherently subjective, semi-quantitative assessment of a handful of pre-selected behavioral signs of epilepsy in animal models. Here we used machine learning-assisted 3D video analysis to reveal hidden behavioral phenotypes in mice with acquired and genetic epilepsies, and tracked their alterations during post-insult epileptogenesis and in response to anti-epileptic drugs. These results show the persistent reconfiguration of behavioral fingerprint in epilepsy and indicate that they can be employed for rapid, automated anti-epileptic drug testing at scale.------This repository contains code from the manuscript ""Hidden Behavioral Fingerprints in Epilepsy"" (2023) to analyze behavioral fingerprints obtained from Motion Sequencing (MoSeq).

HathorBank is the first result of a 2 years PostDoctoral project reassessing the presence of words of Levantine orginis in Late Egyptian (Late Bronze Age). Several words of Levantine origins (especially Semitic, but not only) are known in Egyptian, and various publications listing them exist. However, these words have never been studied from a perspective that systematically investigates their linguistic history, and that explores the socio-cultural context(s) of their transfer and use(s).Moreover, this very rich linguistic material (which e.g. includes the earliest attestations of several Semitic words) has often been presented in forms that targeted a primarily Egyptological audience, rather than being aimed at the wider linguistic community.The HathorBank project takes these considerations into account, and builds on previous and current scholarship in order to further explore both the linguistic dimension of these words and what their presence in Egyptian can tell us about the interactions of the societies of the time.This database constitutes the first output of this project, and its main aim is to make the primary data available. It will soon be followed by a publication that will tackle methodological issues, and which will provide a socio-historical analysis of these words and their spread. As a start, my project has focused on a selection of 243 words that have been identified in previous scholarship as very likely Levantine loanwords (mostly categories 4 and 5 in the classification by Hoch 1994 Semitic Words in Egyptian Texts). Other words will hopefully be added in the future (and collaborations in this direction are very welcome).The present database makes the primary data available and provides, for each word, a reconstruction of their vocalization (wherever possible), a general overview of the distribution of their attestations (across time, and across texts), and a punctual discussion of their relevant features.;Kilani, Marwan;https://hathorbank.herokuapp.com/HathorBank/;;https://hathorbank.herokuapp.com/HathorBank/;HathorBank;HathorBank;D7126901-CF08-4BC8-86C6-0F555B33CACB;186657
A subset of 31 digitised open access trade catalogues of architectural products held by the V&A National Art Library. Digitisation occurred as a partnership between the Victoria and Albert Museum NAL and conservation departments and the grantee. The digitisation platform is Internet Archive, and the new materials form part of the National Art Library's larger collection of almost 1000 open-access items on IA. There will be further arrangements made to create a sub-collection for these architectural trade catalogues so they are grouped together and can be easily found. There are longer term plans to integrate the trade catalogues archives of the V&A National Art Library and the Caroline Simpson Library in Sydney as they contain complementary materials. Both exist on the IA platform.;"Jones, Emma; nalbooks,";"https://archive.org/details/nationalartlibrary ";2022-02-01T00:00:00Z;https://archive.org/details/nationalartlibrary?sort=-addeddate&and[]=subject%3A%22Trade+catalogues%22&and[]=languageSorter%3A%22English%22&and[]=creator%3A%22maw+%26+co.%22&and[]=creator%3A%22army+%26+navy+co-operative+society%22&and[]=creator%3A%22cox+and+sons%22&and[]=creator%3A%22gilbert+j.+french%22&and[]=creator%3A%22b.+crosby+and+co.%22&and[]=creator%3A%22blashfield%2C+john+marriott%22&and[]=creator%3A%22charles+joseph+hullmandel%2C+1789-1850%22&and[]=creator%3A%22coalbrookdale+company%22&;"V&A National Art Library ";V&A National Art Library: C19th Trade Catalogues (architectural) collection subset;44AB5D4F-6184-4EB7-8C2E-10A175F4B0E0;186654

Magma reservoirs are not directly accessible, limiting our capability to understand the prerequisites for an explosive eruption and our ability to perform experiments that simulate magmatic processes at depth. Therefore, deciphering volcanic precursors is key to forecasting volcanic eruptions. In the publication related to these datasets, we used synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy to observe felsic magma vesiculation at high temperature (1100 C) to establish the pre-eruptive conditions that favor explosive activity. Specifically, we studied the increase of seismic attenuation with increasing gas content during magma vesiculation.;"Caricchi, Luca; Fife, Julie; Mader, Kevin; Marone, Federica; Pistone, Mattia; Reusser, Eric; Tisato, Nicola; Ulmer, Peter";doi.org/10.16907/a672b15a-9973-4d92-bf1e-3488cdfb4d1b;2021-03-25T00:00:00Z;https://doi.psi.ch/detail/10.16907/a672b15a-9973-4d92-bf1e-3488cdfb4d1b;Paul Scherrer Institut;"Tomographic data from GRL paper on ""Seismic attenuation during magma vesiculation: A combination of laboratory constraints and modeling";78AB9533-CFCE-456C-A1FE-B267F1B7B28A;168166

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype characterized by extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. To investigate the underlying biology, we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of >1500 cells from six primary TNBC. Here, we show that intercellular heterogeneity of gene expression programs within each tumor is variable and largely correlates with clonality of inferred genomic copy number changes, suggesting that genotype drives the gene expression phenotype of individual subpopulations. Clustering of gene expression profiles identified distinct subgroups of malignant cells shared by multiple tumors, including a single subpopulation associated with multiple signatures of treatment resistance and metastasis, and characterized functionally by activation of glycosphingolipid metabolism and associated innate immunity pathways. A novel signature defining this subpopulation predicts long-term outcomes for TNBC patients in a large cohort. Collectively, this analysis reveals the functional heterogeneity and its association with genomic evolution in TNBC, and uncovers unanticipated biological principles dictating poor outcomes in this disease.;"Bernstein, Bradley E; Cristea, Simona; Ellisen, Leif W; Gillespie, Shawn M; Karaayvaz, Mihriban; Luo, Christina C; Michor, Franziska; Mylvaganam, Ravindra; Patel, Anoop P; Specht, Michelle C";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA485423;2018-10-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118390;GEO;Unravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seq.;20AE338C-D218-42F4-BE2A-BC87CB42EEEE;175139

Ongoing adaptive evolution, and resulting ‘evolutionary rescue’ of declining populations, requires additive genetic variation in fitness. Such variation can be increased by gene flow resulting from immigration, potentially facilitating evolution. But, gene flow could in fact constrain rather than facilitate local adaptive evolution if immigrants have low additive genetic values for local fitness. Local migration-selection balance and micro-evolutionary stasis could then result. However, key quantitative genetic effects of natural immigration, comprising the degrees to which gene flow increases the total local additive genetic variance yet counter-acts local adaptive evolutionary change, have not been explicitly quantified in wild populations. Key implications of gene flow for population and evolutionary dynamics consequently remain unclear. Our quantitative genetic analyses of long-term data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) show that mean breeding value for local juvenile survival to adulthood, a major component of fitness, increased across cohorts more than expected solely due to drift. Such micro-evolutionary change should be expected given non-zero additive genetic variance and consistent directional selection. However, this evolutionary increase was counter-acted by negative additive genetic effects of recent immigrants, which increased total additive genetic variance but prevented a net directional evolutionary increase in total additive genetic value. These analyses imply an approximate quantitative genetic migration-selection balance in a major fitness component, and hence demonstrate a key mechanism by which substantial additive genetic variation can be maintained yet decoupled from local adaptive evolutionary change.;"Arcese, Peter; Dickel, Lisa; Keller, Lukas; Muff, Stefanie; Nietlisbach, Pirmin; Reid, Jane; Wolak, Matthew";doi:10.5061/dryad.rjdfn2z95;;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.rjdfn2z95;Dryad;Data for: Immigration counter-acts local micro-evolution of a major fitness component: migration-selection balance in free-living song sparrows;F6566BB9-5E87-4DB9-954B-383E2E6688EB;180870

Despite extensive evidence that biodiversity promotes plant community productivity, progress towards understanding the mechanistic basis of this effect remains slow, impeding the development of predictive ecological theory and agricultural applications. Here, we analysed non-additive interactions between genetically divergent Arabidopsis accessions in experimental plant communities. By combining methods from ecology and genetics, we identified a major effect locus that promotes complementarity amongst genotypes and above-ground productivity in mixed communities. In experiments with near-isogenic lines, we show that this diversity effect can act independently of other genomic regions and be resolved to a single locus representing less than 0.3% of the genome. Using plant-soil-feedback experiments, we demonstrate that allelic diversity also causes genotype-specific soil legacy responses in a subsequent growing period. Our work thus shows that positive diversity effects can be linked to single Mendelian factors, and that a range of complex community properties, some of which manifest themselves even after the original community has disappeared, can have a simple, single cause. This may pave the way to novel breeding strategies, focussing on phenotypic properties that manifest themselves beyond isolated individuals, i.e. at a higher level of biological organisation.;"Niklaus, Pascal; Wuest, Samuel";10.5281/zenodo.1254563;2018-06-21T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org;Zenodo;A plant biodiversity effect resolved to a single genetic locus - datasets;E19E98C5-FC54-4D69-9CD5-D6676FB69FAE;148223

This data set contains measurements from various sensors installed on the Aqualine Ferrybox system that was connected to the underway seawater supply in the Southern Ocean during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Data was collected continuously except for periods when the pump of the underway system was switched off or the system was turned off. Data collection covers all three cruise legs in the period 24th December 2016 to 18th March 2017. Data collected with the CTG MiniPack CTD-F are temperature, salinity, pressure, and turbidity. Data collected by the Aanderaa oxygen optode include dissolved oxygen and oxygen saturation. An SBE 18 sensor measured pH. The CTG UniLux fluorometer measured chlorophyll-a concentration. All data has been quality controlled and post-cruise calibrated. Data is provided at 1-minute intervals along the cruise track. In addition, we provide satellite data (sea-surface temperature, sea-surface height, geostrophic velocity, sea-ice concentration) that was interpolated to the cruise-track and an estimate of frontal positions to supplement this underway data set where data was missing or for additional information. This circumpolar data set provides insights into the circumpolar surface ocean conditions and biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean during one austral summer season.Note on version 1.0: The first version of this data set only contains temperature, salinity, pressure, and potential density in the post-processed file, since post-processing and quality control for turbidity, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, and pH have not been finalized. These variables will be added to the post-processed data file in a future release.;"Gerber, Franziska; Haumann, F.

Mounting theoretical evidence suggests that demographic stochasticity, environmental heterogeneity and biased movement of organisms individually affect the dynamics of biological invasions and range expansions. Studies of species spread in heterogeneous landscapes have traditionally characterized invasion velocities as functions of the mean resource density throughout the landscape, thus neglecting higher-order moments of the spatial resource distribution. Here, we show theoretically that different spatial arrangements of resources lead to different spread velocities even if the mean resource density throughout the landscape is kept constant. Specifically, we find that increasing the resource autocorrelation length causes a reduction in the speed of species spread. The model shows that demographic stochasticity plays a key role in the slowdown, which is strengthened when individuals can actively move towards resources. We then experimentally corroborated the theoretically predicted reduction in propagation speed in microcosm experiments with the protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in landscapes with different resource autocorrelation lengths. Our work identifies the resource autocorrelation length as a key modulator and a simple measure of landscape susceptibility to biological invasions, which needs to be considered for predicting invasion dynamics within naturally heterogeneous environmental corridors.;"Altermatt, Florian; Giometto, Andrea; Rinaldo, Andrea";10.5061/dryad.51mq6;2017-04-05T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.51mq6;Dryad;Demographic stochasticity and resource autocorrelation control biological invasions in heterogeneous landscapes;EE74AD3A-AF45-4F00-A6D4-2ED512C6CD33;179089

Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents release not only chemical constituents in watersheds, but also contain microorganisms. Thus, an understanding of what microorganisms are released and how they change microbial communities within natural streams is needed. To characterize the community shifts in streams receiving WWTP effluent, we sampled water-column microorganisms from upstream, downstream, and the effluent of WWTPs located on 23 headwater streams in which no other effluent was released upstream. We characterized the bacterial community by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We hypothesized that the downstream community profile would be a hydraulic mixture between the two sources (i.e., upstream and effluent). In ordination analyses, the downstream bacterial community profile was a mixture between the upstream and effluent. For 14 of the sites, the main contribution (>50%) to the downstream community originated from bacteria in the WWTP effluent and significant shifts in relative abundance of specific sequence variants were detected. These shifts in sequence variants may serve as general bioindicators of wastewater-effluent influenced streams, with a human-gut related Ruminococcus genus displaying the highest shift (30-fold higher abundances downstream). However, not all taxa composition changes were predicted based on hydraulic mixing alone. Specifically, the decrease of Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast reads was not adequately described by hydraulic mixing. The potential alteration of stream microbial communities via a high inflow of human-gut related bacteria and a decrease in autotrophic functional groups resulting from WWTP effluent creates the potential for general shifts in stream ecosystem function.;"Altermatt, Florian; Deiner, Kristy; Eggen, Rik I.L.; Fenner, Kathrin; Mächler, Elvira; Mansfeldt, Cresten; Schönenberger, Urs; Stamm, Christian; Walser, Jean-Claude";0000-0002-4831-6958;2020-03-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4540304.v1;Dryad;Microbial community shifts in streams receiving treated wastewater effluent;5C70DA68-7AD1-4F17-89A2-25424B81D02A;179089
Context: Freshwater ecosystems depend on surrounding terrestrial landscape for resources. Most important are terrestrial leaf litter subsidies, which differ depending on land use. We lack a good understanding of the variation of these inputs across spatial scales. Objectives: We sought to determine: (1) the relative importance of local versus catchment-level forestation for benthic leaf litter biomass in streams, (2) how landscape configuration alters these relationships, and (3) how land use affects the quality and diversity of leaf litter subsidies. Methods: We measured biomass and identity of benthic leaf litter in 121 reaches in 10 independent catchments seasonally over the course of a year. We assessed direct and indirect effects of forestation, reach position, and seasonality on leaf litter biomass using structural equation models, and assessed how leaf litter diversity varied with land use. Results: In catchments with forested headwaters, the degree of forestation and reach position in the catchment influenced benthic leaf litter biomass indirectly through local reach-scale forestation. In catchments where forest was only located downstream, or with minimal forest, none of these factors influenced reach-level benthic leaf litter. Leaf litter diversity peaked in fall in all land use types, but was generally lowest in forested reaches. Conclusions: Not only habitat amount, but its location relative to other habitats is important for ecosystem function in the context of cross-ecosystem material flows. Here, lack of upstream forest altered spatial patterns of leaf litter storage. Studies with high spatiotemporal resolution may further reveal effects of landscape configuration on other ecosystems.;"Altermatt, Florian; Little, Chelsea J.";10.5061/dryad.j675k0j;2019-07-10T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.j675k0j;Dryad;Landscape configuration alters spatial arrangement of terrestrial-aquatic subsidies in headwater streams;69DEBE75-3AEC-4D71-9FD0-2812FF2FA2E9;179089
Most spatial ecology focuses on how species dispersal affects community dynamics and coexistence. Ecosystems, however, are also commonly connected by flows of resources. We experimentally tested how neighbouring communities indirectly influence each other in absence of dispersal, via resource exchanges. Using two-patch microcosm meta-ecosystems, we manipulated community composition and dynamics, by varying separately species key functional traits (autotroph versus heterotroph species and size of consumer species) and trophic structure of aquatic communities (species growing alone, or in presence of competitors or predators). We then analysed the effects of species functional traits and trophic structure on communities connected through spatial subsidies in the absence of actual dispersal. Both functional traits and trophic structure strongly affected dynamics across neighbouring communities. Heterotroph communities connected to autotroph neighbours developed better than with heterotroph neighbours, such that coexistence of competitors was determined by the functional traits of the neighbouring community. Densities in autotroph communities were also strikingly higher when receiving subsidies from heterotroph communities compared to their own subsidies when grown in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, communities connected to predator-dominated ecosystems collapsed, without any direct contact with the predators. Our results demonstrate that because community composition and structure modify the distribution of biomass within a community, they may also affect communities connected through subsidies through quantitative and qualitative changes of detritus flows. This stresses that ecosystem management should account for such interdependencies mediated by spatial subsidies, given that local community alterations cascade across space onto other ecosystems even if species dispersal is completely absent.;"Altermatt, Florian; Ganesanandamoorthy, Pravin; Gounand, Isabelle; Harvey, Eric";10.5061/dryad.93hd6;2016-11-21T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.93hd6;Dryad;Subsidies mediate interactions between communities across space;0EFB4AAA-2717-4C63-BFB6-2A0B3DC254A9;179089

Appropriately defining and enumerating ‘fitness’ is fundamental to explaining and predicting evolutionary dynamics. Yet, general theoretical concepts of fitness are often hard to translate into quantities that can be measured in wild populations experiencing complex environmental, demographic, genetic and selective variation. While the ‘fittest’ entities might be widely understood to be those that ultimately leave most descendants at some future time, such long-term legacies can rarely be measured, impeding evaluation of the degree to which tractable short-term metrics of individual fitness could potentially serve as useful direct proxies. One opportunity for conceptual and empirical convergence stems from the principle of individual reproductive value (Vi), defined as the number of copies of each of an individual’s alleles that is expected to be present in future generations given the individual’s realised pedigree of descendants. Since Vi tightly predicts an individual’s longer-term genetic contribution, quantifying Vi provides a tractable route to quantifying what, to date, has been an abstract theoretical fitness concept. We used complete pedigree data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to demonstrate that individuals’ expected genetic contributions stabilise within an observed 20-year (i.e. ~8 generation) time period, allowing estimation of individual Vi. Considerable among-individual variation in Vi was evident in both sexes. Standard metrics of individual lifetime fitness, comprising lifespan, lifetime reproductive success and projected growth rate, typically explained less than half the variation. We thereby elucidate the degree to which fitness metrics observed on individuals concur with measures of longer-term genetic contributions, and consider the degree to which analyses of pedigree structure could provide useful complementary insights into evolutionary outcomes.;"Arcese, Peter; Keller, Lukas; Nietlisbach, Pirmin; Reid, Jane; Wolak, Matthew";10.5061/dryad.cf388r6;;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.cf388r6;Dryad;Data from: Individuals’ expected genetic contributions to future generations, reproductive value, and short-term metrics of fitness in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia);8D2C1050-D31C-4837-A408-304F3D058837;180870
Neutrophils are the most numerous cells in the leukocyte population and essential for innate immunity. To limit their effector functions, neutrophils are able to modulate glycolysis and other cellular metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways are essential not only for energy usage, but also for specialized effector actions, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), chemotaxis, phagocytosis, degranulation, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). It has been demonstrated that activated viable neutrophils can produce NETs, which consists of a DNA scaffold able to bind granule proteins and microorganisms. The formation of NETs requires the availability of increased amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as it is an active cellular and therefore energy-dependent process. In this article, we discuss the glycolytic and other metabolic routes in association with neutrophil functions focusing on their role for building up NETs in the extracellular space. A better understanding of the requirements of metabolic pathways for neutrophil functions may lead to the discovery of molecular targets suitable to develop novel anti-infectious and/or anti-inflammatory drugs.;Stojkov, Darko;"10.3389/fimmu.2022.826515 ";2022-02-09T00:00:00Z;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35251008/;"10.3389/fimmu.2022.826515 ";Physiological and Pathophysiological Roles of Metabolic Pathways for NET Formation and Other Neutrophil Functions;2972D0C5-9ED8-468D-B671-347CC6CA86F2;191063

The ability to engineer nonlinear optical emission from nanostructures is a key challenge to create efficient and compact components for integrated devices. This paper shows a method to control and manipulate the directionality of second‐harmonic generation emission by engineering geometry and position of rod nanoantennas. Single and dimer nanoantennas are fabricated by slicing III-V semiconductor nanowires with focused ion beam milling. The nonlinear optical response of nanoantennas is tailored by adjusting their length and position to achieve a targeted phase difference. The studied GaAs nanoantennas have a wurtzite structure that allows to achieve preferable directions for the second‐harmonic emission compared to a typical bulk zinc blende structure from top‐down fabricated nanostructures. Wurtzite nanoantennas provide a pure electric dipole response at the second‐harmonic wavelength, which together with pi‐phase control of emitted light is used for designing nonlinear emission patterns. The simulation results show how to redirect the second‐harmonic beam up to 30° and how to tailor the emission profile by adding elements. This method of second‐harmonic generation manipulation and phase array engineering can be applied to different types of nanowires and nanostructures. Nonlinear beam steering with structures from nanowires will foster the creation of compact optical components for integrated circuits.;Timofeeva, Maria;10.1002/lpor.202000028;2020-09-20T00:00:00Z;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/429144;ETH server;Engineering of the Second‐Harmonic Emission Directionality with III–V Semiconductor Rod Nanoantennas;A90B815C-985F-4A1B-9B98-6E197FEB2EA6;179966

"Objectives: We aimed to assess the burden of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales in Swiss long-term care facilities (LTCFs) to describe the molecular epidemiology, describe the intra-institutional and regional clusters of resistant pathogens, and identify independent institution- and resident-level factors associated with colonization.Design: Cross-sectional study.Setting and participants: From August to October 2019, we performed a point prevalence study among residents from 16 LTCFs in Western and Eastern Switzerland (8 per region).Methods: Residents underwent screening for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E); whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed. We gathered institution-level (eg, number of beds, staff-resident ratio, alcoholic hand rub consumption) and resident-level [eg, anthropometric data, time in facility, dependency, health care exposure, antibiotic treatment, proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use] characteristics. Factors associated with colonization were identified using a generalized linear model.Results: Among 1185 eligible residents, 606 (51%) consented to the study. ESBL-E prevalence was 11.6% (70/606), ranging from 1.9% to 33.3% between institutions, with a median of 12.5% in the West and 6.9% in the East (P = .03). Among 59 Escherichia coli (from 58 residents), multilocus sequence type (ST) 131 was most common (n = 43/59, 73%), predominantly its subclone H30R1 (n = 37/43, 86%). WGS data identified multiple intra-institutional and regional clusters. Independent risk factors for ESBL carriage were previous ESBL colonization [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 23.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.6-83.8, P < .001), male gender (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.6, P = .002), and use of PPIs (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.8, P = .01).Conclusions and implications: Overall ESBL-E prevalence in Swiss LTCF residents is low.

Is the neutral ISM in the Galaxy clumpy? Does pristine gas infalling on the disk immediately mix with the metal-enriched gas? Recent medium-resolution STIS studies found frequent sub-solar metallicities in the neutral ISM, integrated along the line of sight, suggesting the contribution of low-metallicity gas. Intriguingly, in some cases deviations from the expected depletion patterns were observed for volatile elements. One possible explanation for both effects is a mix between metal/dust-rich and pristine gas (low metallicity and zero depletion) in the ISM. Indeed, an inhomogeneous ISM mix has been recently observed in high-resolution STIS observations of HD 62542. Here we propose to target 8 lines of sight that show potential contribution of pristine gas in the following ways: 1) low metallicity integrated along the line of sight, 2) deviations in the depletion of the volatile elements, and 3) complex/asymmetric kinematics, as measured from lower-resolution studies. The STIS high-resolution will enable a component-by-component analysis to characterize the depletion properties of individual clumps. Our primary goal is to constrain dust-rich and dust-free ISM clumps towards our targets. In addition, we aim at roughly constraining the metallicity of these ISM clumps by exploring the parameter space that can reproduce the observed deviations of the volatile elements. This way we will characterize the inhomogeneities in the ISM and unveil the potential presence of clumps of pristine gas. While chemical evolution models show that infalling pristine gas is necessary to sustain star formation and reproduce the observed abundances, its presence in the ISM is yet to be confirmed....;"De Cia, Annalisa; Fox, Andrew J.; Jenkins, Edward B.; Konstantopoulou, Christina; Krogager, Jens-Kristian; Ledoux, Cedric; Ramburuth-Hurt, Tanita; Welty, Daniel E.";https://mast.stsci.edu/search/ui/#/hst/results?proposal_id=16750;2023-06-09T00:00:00Z;https://mast.stsci.edu/search/ui/#/hst/results?proposal_id=16750;Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes;Inhomogeneities and pristine gas infall in the ISM;E4A15464-94E1-4CA8-B70C-1F1059A35556;185692

Abstract The bacterial division apparatus catalyses the synthesis and remodelling of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) to build the cell wall layer that fortifies the daughter cell poles. Understanding of this essential process has been limited by the lack of native three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli . We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the septal architecture and mode of division can be modified to more closely resemble that of other Gram-negative ( Caulobacter crescentus ) or Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria, suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the formation of different septal morphologies. Finally, analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation (Δ envC Δ nlpD ) showed that cell wall remodelling affects the placement and stability of the cytokinetic ring.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) is Ser/Thr protein kinase highly expressed in medulloblastoma (MB) patient samples which promotes cell migration and invasiveness downstream of growth factor receptors. Although MAP4K4 implication in the control of the membrane protrusions at the leading edge of cells during migration and invasion in MB is established, its downstream effectors governing and mediating this process in MB have not been identified. In this study we explored the proteomic neighborhood of MAP4K4 in MB cells and to identify candidate potentially affecting its activity and pro-migratory functions. Towards this aim, we expressed BioID fused versions of MAP4K4 (N- and C-terminal) in DAOY cells under presence of biotin. In the control setup, we expressed the BioID enzyme alone. After Streptavidin purification of biotinylated proteins, we performed mass spectrometry and quantified relative abundances compared to control conditions.;Baumgartner, Martin;PXD031870;2022-08-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD031870;Pride;BioID proximity labelling of MAP4K4 interactors in DAOY medulloblastoma cells;ECB8EC43-4A37-4D4A-B94D-BAF8F7B763DC;202245

The accurate cleavage of pre-micro(mi)RNAs by Dicer and mi/siRNA guide strand selection are important steps in forming the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The role of Dicer binding partner TRBP in these processes remains poorly understood. Here, we solved the solution structure of the two N-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) of TRBP in complex with a functionally asymmetric siRNA using NMR, EPR, and single-molecule spectroscopy. We find that siRNA recognition by the dsRBDs is not sequence-specific but rather depends on the RNA shape. The two dsRBDs can swap their binding sites, giving rise to two equally populated, pseudo-symmetrical complexes, showing that TRBP is not a primary sensor of siRNA asymmetry. Using our structure to model a Dicer-TRBP-siRNA ternary complex, we show that TRBP's dsRBDs and Dicer's RNase III domains bind a canonical 19 base pair siRNA on opposite sides, supporting a mechanism whereby TRBP influences Dicer-mediated cleavage accuracy by binding the dsRNA region of the pre-miRNA during Dicer cleavage.;Masliah, Gregoire;https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5N8L;2018-02-21T00:00:00Z;https://www.rcsb.org;RCSB Protein Data Bank;Macromolecular Structure;930796C3-B545-4829-A744-651806D16DB4;170976

"Data and code for ""New Deal, New Patriots"" by Caprettini and Voth (QJE 2023).We demonstrate an important complementarity between patriotism and public-good provision. After 1933, the New Deal led to an unprecedented expansion of the US federal government’s role. Those who benefited from social spending were markedly more patriotic during WWII: they bought more war bonds, volunteered more, and, as soldiers, won more medals. This pattern was new-WWI volunteering did not show the same geography of patriotism. We match military service records with the 1940 census to show that this pattern holds at the individual level. Using geographical variation, we exploit two instruments to suggest that the effect is causal: droughts and congressional committee representation predict more New Deal agricultural support, as well as bond buying, volunteering, and medals.";"Caprettini, Bruno; Hans-Joachim, Voth";https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac028;2022-07-06T00:00:00Z;https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/qje/qjac028/6623686?login=false;Quarterly Journal of Economics;"Data and code for: ""New Deal, New Patriots: How 1930s Government Spending Boosted Patriotism During WWII""";A2B70421-78D7-4B32-93C9-5D11F20103F6;173998

Theoretical models of cooperation typically assume that agents use simple rules based on last encounters, such as ‘tit-for-tat’, to reciprocate help. By contrast, empiricists generally suppose that animals integrate multiple experiences over longer timespans. Here, we compared these two alternative hypotheses by exposing Norway rats to partners that cooperated on three consecutive days but failed to cooperate on the fourth day, and to partners that did the exact opposite. In additional controls, focal rats experienced cooperating and defecting partners only once. In a bar-pulling setup, focal rats based their decision to provide partners with food on last encounters instead of overall cooperation levels. To check whether this might be owing to a lack of memory capacity, we tested whether rats remember the outcome of encounters that had happened three days before. Cooperation was not diminished by the intermediate time interval. We conclude that rats reciprocate help mainly based on most recent encounters instead of integrating social experience over longer timespans.;Schweinfurth, Manon;https://doi.org/10.17630/20046e0b-4d00-483d-a406-dffe0b14e46d;2020-01-15T00:00:00Z;https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/rats-play-titfortat-instead-of-integrating-cooperative-experiences-over-multiple-interactions-dataset(20046e0b-4d00-483d-a406-dffe0b14e46d).html;PURE, St Andrews;Rats play tit-for-tat instead of integrating cooperative experiences over multiple interactions;AF27D896-ECC6-4B70-A1DF-5EE3E0F0F859;175269
Reciprocal cooperation may evolve if the costs of help are reliably compensated for by delayed returns provided in future interactions. The associated probabilities and cost-benefit ratios may vary systematically between the sexes, which often display different dispersal strategies and interaction patterns. Whereas female Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, are known to apply direct and generalized decision rules of reciprocal cooperation, the rules according to which males reciprocate favours are less well understood. Therefore, we investigated the cooperation propensity of male wild-type Norway rats. Male test rats experienced cooperating partners that provided food to them, or defecting partners that refused to provide help. Afterwards, test rats could donate food to previously experienced or unknown partners, resembling direct and generalized reciprocity paradigms, respectively. Male rats cooperated according to direct reciprocity, suggesting that this decision rule is similarly important for both sexes. However, whereas females additionally help according to generalized reciprocity, males did not apply this rule. These results suggest a sex difference in reciprocal decision rules, highlighting the potential importance of different interaction patterns and cost-benefit ratios between the sexes.;Schweinfurth, Manon;https://doi.org/10.17630/971c173d-9ef9-4783-9a65-1d2c4cfc2a8a;2020-05-18T00:00:00Z;https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/male-rats-cooperate-according-to-direct-reciprocity-but-not-to-generalised-reciprocity-dataset(971c173d-9ef9-4783-9a65-1d2c4cfc2a8a).html;PURE, St Andrews;" Male rats cooperate according to direct reciprocity  but not to generalised reciprocity ";839482E5-61FA-4ABA-89E8-DBF6B1B1CEAB;175269

Understanding the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in adaptation is a key challenge in evolutionary biology. In microbes, an important mechanism of HGT is prophage acquisition (phage genomes integrated into bacterial chromosomes). Prophages can influence bacterial fitness via transfer of beneficial genes (including antibiotic-resistance genes, ARGs), protection from superinfecting phages, or switching to a lytic lifecycle which releases free phages infectious to competitors. We expect these effects to depend on environmental conditions because of, for example, environment-dependent induction of the lytic lifecycle. However, it remains unclear how costs/benefits of prophages vary across environments. Here, studying prophages with/without ARGs in Escherichia coli, we disentangled effects of prophages alone and adaptive genes they carry. In competition with prophage-free strains, benefits from prophages and ARGs peaked in different environments. Prophages were most beneficial when induction of the lytic lifecycle was common, whereas ARGs were more beneficial upon antibiotic exposure and with reduced prophage induction. Acquisition of prophage-encoded ARGs by competing strains was most common when prophage induction, and therefore free phages, were common. Thus, selection on prophages and adaptive genes they carry varies independently across environments, which is important for predicting the spread of mobile/integrating genetic elements and their role in evolution;"Hall, Alex; Refardt, Dominik; Wendling, Carolin Charlotte";https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z350c;2020-12-17T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.dfn2z350c;dryad;Data from: Fitness benefits to bacteria of carrying prophages and prophage-encoded antibiotic-resistance genes peak in different environments;89EBD585-18A4-4706-BEEB-7017ED0FEFC1;179743

Spatial snow and ice thickness measurements from ice stations PS81/503, PS81/506 and PS81/517 from Research Vessel Polarstern in the Antarctic Weddell Sea in austral winter 2013 (cruise leg ANT-XXIX/6, AWECS campaign). Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was used to determine the snow surface height above sea level for an approximately 50x50m patch. The reference to sea level was obtained using registration targets drilled through the ice with a measured distance between the target and the water level in the drill holes. Magnaprobe measures snow depth (Sturm et al., 2018) and the GEM-2 instrument measures the combined snow and ice thickness (Hunkeler et al., 2016). Magnaprobe and GEM-2 was performed inside the laser scan field after all scans had been acquired. Additionally floe-scale walks were performed using Magnaprobe and GEM-2 to capture variability on a larger scale than the laser scan field. Further information can be found in Wever et al. (2021).;"Hunkeler, Priska; Leonard, Katherine; Maksym, Ted; Wever, Nander; White, Seth";10.1594/PANGAEA.933584;2021-08-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.933584;Pangaea.de;Snow and ice thickness measurements from Terrestrial Laser Scanning, Magnaprobe and GEM-2 on ice stations PS81/503, PS81/506 and PS81/517 from Weddell Sea, Antarctica, 2013.;7B1BFC1C-145A-4144-A6C1-222C8FD4B567;172299
Ice mass balance (IMB) buoy data PS81/506 from Weddell Sea, Antarctica, 2013-2014. The buoy was deployed together with an automatic weather station buoy (see under related) on sea ice station PS81/506 from Research Vessel Polarstern in the Antarctic Weddell Sea in austral winter 2013 (cruise leg ANT-XXIX/6, AWECS campaign). The IMB buoy provides data between 2013-07-13T12:15:00 and 2014-02-07T01:17:00.The IMB buoy was kindly provided by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS). The IMB buoy consisted of a thermistor string of 5 m length, with a 2 cm sensor spacing. Interfaces were determined by hand. The bottom interface was determined from the existence of a knee in the temperature profile where apparent, combined with the heating cycle data. Both the amount of heating, and the ratio of heating at 60s over heating at 30s were used. This is very accurate up until ~day 300, and it is probably about +/- 4 cm after that. The snow interface was determined by the above, and looking at the knee in the temperature profile for each of the four temperature profiles during the day. This is more difficult to pick out, so accuracy here is maybe a few cm. Note flooding occurred at ~day 290 (probably up to freeboard level on ~day 278). The flooding interface was determined from day 250 on, and based mostly on the heating cycle. Clear surface snow melt on ~day 330, and IMB goes isothermal and warm on ~day 350. It may be that the thermistor string was pulled out of the ice, since it is warm at the sensors that were in the ocean.;"Maksym, Ted; Wever, Nander; White, Seth";10.1594/PANGAEA.933417;2021-08-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.933417;Pangaea.de;"Ice mass balance data PS81/506-1 from Weddell Sea, Antarctica, 2013-2014.

Abstract The bacterial division apparatus catalyses the synthesis and remodelling of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) to build the cell wall layer that fortifies the daughter cell poles. Understanding of this essential process has been limited by the lack of native three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli . We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the septal architecture and mode of division can be modified to more closely resemble that of other Gram-negative ( Caulobacter crescentus ) or Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria, suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the formation of different septal morphologies. Finally, analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation (Δ envC Δ nlpD ) showed that cell wall remodelling affects the placement and stability of the cytokinetic ring. Taken together, our results support a model in which competition between the cell elongation and division machineries determines the shape of cell constrictions and the poles they form. They also highlight how the activity of the division system can be modulated to help generate the diverse array of shapes observed in the bacterial domain.;"Allolio, Christoph; Ananda, Virly Y.; Bernhardt, Thomas G.; Chao, Luke H.; Llopis, Paula Montero; Navarro, Paula P.; Vettiger, Andrea";Navarro-et-al_2022;2022-09-12T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/NavarroVettiger/Navarro-et-al_2022;Github;Cell wall synthesis and remodelling dynamics determine division site architecture and cell shape in Escherichia coli;D597194E-8076-4055-8832-FA384B3F76D8;188112

The way that organisms diverge into reproductively isolated species is a major question in biology. The recent accumulation of genomic data provides promising opportunities to understand the genomic landscape of divergence, which describes the distribution of differences across genomes. Genomic areas of unusually high differentiation have been called genomic islands of divergence. Their formation has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms, but a prominent hypothesis is that they result from divergent selection over a small portion of the genome, with surrounding areas homogenised by gene flow. Such islands have often been interpreted as being associated with divergence with gene flow. However other mechanisms related to genomic structure and population history can also contribute to the formation of genomic islands of divergence.We currently lack a quantitative framework to examine the dynamics of genomic landscapes under the complex and nuanced conditions that are found in natural systems. Here, we develop an individual-based simulation to explore the dynamics of diverging genomes under various scenarios of gene flow, selection and genotype-phenotype maps.Our modelling results are consistent with empirical observations demonstrating the formation of genomic islands under genetic isolation. Importantly, we have quantified the range of conditions that produce genomic islands. We demonstrate that the initial level of genetic diversity, drift, time since divergence, linkage disequilibrium, strength of selection and gene flow are all important factors that can influence the formation of genomic islands. Because the accumulation of genomic differentiation over time tends to erode the signal of genomic islands, genomic islands are more likely to be observed in recently divergent taxa, although not all recently diverged taxa will necessarily exhibit islands of genomic divergence. Gene flow primarily slows the swamping of islands of divergence with time.By using this framework, further studies may explore the relative influence of particular suites of events that contribute to the emergence of genomic islands under sympatric, parapatric and allopatric conditions. This approach represents a novel tool to explore quantitative expectations of the speciation process, and should prove useful in elucidating past and projecting future genomic evolution of any taxa.;"Anderson, Eric; Clegg, Sonya; Coulson, Tim; Quilodrán, Claudio; Ruegg, Kristen; Sendell-Price, Ashley";10.5061/dryad.12jm63xt0;2020-11-05T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.12jm63xt0;Dryad;The many population genetic and demographic routes to islands of genomic divergence;CB74830B-C817-4D61-849D-9C410A4D8819;183930

The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically driven cross-national survey that has been conducted across Europe since its establishment in 2001. Every two years, face-to-face interviews are conducted with newly selected, cross-sectional samples.The survey measures the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of diverse populations in more than thirty nations.Following an application to the European Commission which was submitted by the UK on behalf of 14 other countries, the ESS was awarded European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) status on 30th November 2013. Following this change, Russia could not take part in the ESS anymore. PAWCER assured data collection and ERIC contribution for the Russian team and supported research on the cross-cultural comparability of data between Europe and Russia;European Social Surv,;10.21338/NSD-ESS8-2016;2018-05-30T00:00:00Z;https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/download.html?file=ESS8RU&c=RU&y=2016;Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD);European Social Survey Round 8 2016 Russian Data;126215AC-D9C7-400B-83A2-565A2635ADAC;164936

AbstractProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a sliding clamp that acts as a central co-ordinator for mismatch repair (MMR) as well as DNA replication. Loss of Elg1, the major subunit of the PCNA unloader complex, causes over-accumulation of PCNA on DNA and also increases mutation rate, but it has been unclear if the two effects are linked. Here we show that timely removal of PCNA from DNA by the Elg1 complex is important to prevent mutations. Although premature unloading of PCNA generally increases mutation rate, the mutator phenotype of elg1Δ is attenuated by PCNA mutants PCNA-R14E and PCNA-D150E that spontaneously fall off DNA. In contrast, the elg1Δ mutator phenotype is exacerbated by PCNA mutants that accumulate on DNA due to enhanced electrostatic PCNA-DNA interactions. Epistasis analysis suggests that PCNA over-accumulation on DNA interferes with both MMR and MMR-independent process(es). In elg1Δ, over-retained PCNA hyper-recruits the Msh2-Msh6 mismatch recognition complex through its PCNA-interacting peptide motif, causing accumulation of MMR intermediates. Our results suggest that PCNA retention controlled by the Elg1 complex is critical for efficient MMR: PCNA needs to be on DNA long enough to enable MMR, but if it is retained too long it interferes with downstream repair steps.;"Gaubitz, Christl; Kelch, Brian A";6D0Q;2019-07-26T00:00:00Z;http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?tabtoshow=Current&qrid=9652185D;RCSB PDB;Structure of a DNA retention-prone PCNA variant;E06C6C13-3655-452C-8403-8C1C3362BCFC;177859
This is a longitudinal prospective cohort study in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome undergoing decompression surgery. Phenotypic data and skin biopsies were collected before and 6 months after surgery to determine molecular and cellular correlates associated with neural regeneration and neuropathic pain. RNA sequencing was performed in the skin samples and differential gene expression was determined post compared to pre surgery. The molecular changes identified in skin were correlated with the clinical phenotype representing neural regeneration.;Schmid, Annina;phs001796.v1.p1;2019-05-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001796.v1.p1;dbGaP;Correlates of Human Nerve Repair;C8358AA1-7142-4D26-A791-358B133D0240;158835

"Lipid droplets (LDs) play a crucial role in the storage and distribution of lipids to control cellular metabolism and bioenergetics (1). How LDs organize the lipid supply to different cellular fates is just starting to be elucidated. Formation of membrane contact sites (MCSs; defined as regions where the two membranes of similar or different organelles are <30 nm from each other) between LDs and target organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria, is emerging as an important mechanism regulating lipid transfer (1, 2). MCSs can ensure timely and local lipid supply, avoiding lipotoxicity and missorting of valuable energetic and metabolic substrates. In support of the biological relevance of these mechanisms, up to 26 different Rab GTPases reside on LDs, representing 20% of the LD proteome (3). Interestingly, a subpopulation of these proteins [e.g., Rab5 (a, b, and c), Rab8 (a and b), Rab11 (a), Rab13, Rab14, Rab15, and Rab21] is also associated with the early endosomal system. Early endosomes (EEs) are the major endocytic compartments mediating sorting of proteins, lipids, and lipoproteins. Early biochemical studies proposed the existence of physical interactions between LDs and EEs (4). The existence of these contacts in mammalian cells has not been further explored. The figure illustrates that EE tubules, defined by the presence of internalized transferrin, interact with LDs in mammalian cells. BHK cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding human transferrin receptor (TfR plus plasmid encoding GFP) and then incubated with transferrin-HRP for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then processed for HRP detection and processed for electron microscopy using a mild fixation/low membrane-contrast staining method to optimize transferrin-HRP visualization. Transferrin-HRP-labeled EE tubules (arrows) were specifically associated with LDs (asterisks) as shown in the low magnification overview (left panel) and at higher magnification in the lower right panel. The two pseudocolored panels show higher magnification views of the neighboring panels, with ER in blue and the LD monolayer in orange; note the tripartite interaction with the EE tubule (EE, arrows). The images clearly demonstrate that LDs can form a distinct MCS with tubules of the EE but also that LD-EE contacts can interact in tripartite fashion with the ER. While hitherto elusive in mammalian cells, the existence and function of three-way contacts between lysosomes, LDs, and ER have been well described in yeast (2). With EEs acting as central hubs in lipid trafficking, these observations provide a new perspective on the complexity of LD interactions in mammalian cells.";"Bosch, Marta; Parton, Robert G.; Pol, Albert; Steiner, Bernhard";10.1194/jlr.ILR120000876;2020-11-01T00:00:00Z;https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/RGPEM2020-Q1895;Research Data Manager (RDM) at The University of Queensland: RGPEM2020-Q1895;Novel contact sites between lipid droplets, early endosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum;8EF4A77E-6C96-428C-B2DE-52843F1673A5;184024

Cortical responses to sensory inputs vary across repeated presentations of identical stimuli, but how this trial-to-trial variability impacts detection of sensory inputs is not fully understood. Using multi-channel local field potential (LFP) recordings in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of the awake mouse, we optimized a data-driven cortical state classifier to predict single-trial sensory-evoked responses, based on features of the spontaneous, ongoing LFP recorded across cortical layers. Our findings show that, by utilizing an ongoing prediction of the sensory response generated by this state classifier, an ideal observer improves overall detection accuracy and generates robust detection of sensory inputs across various states of ongoing cortical activity in the awake brain, which could have implications for variability in the performance of detection tasks across brain states.;"He, Biyu J; Pala, Aurelie; Sederberg, Audrey J; Stanley, Garrett B; Zheng, He JV";https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.46cg87c;2019-06-03T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.46cg87c;Dryad Digital Repository;Data from: State-aware detection of sensory stimuli in the cortex of the awake mouse;7AE1E964-24F4-436B-9362-B7AFD03F5BD8;177861

Antimalarial drugs have thus far been chiefly derived from two sources-natural products and synthetic drug-like compounds. Here we investigate whether antimalarial agents with novel mechanisms of action could be discovered using a diverse collection of synthetic compounds that have three-dimensional features reminiscent of natural products and are underrepresented in typical screening collections. We report the identification of such compounds with both previously reported and undescribed mechanisms of action, including a series of bicyclic azetidines that inhibit a new antimalarial target, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. These molecules are curative in mice at a single, low dose and show activity against all parasite life stages in multiple in vivo efficacy models. Our findings identify bicyclic azetidines with the potential to both cure and prevent transmission of the disease as well as protect at-risk populations with a single oral dose, highlighting the strength of diversity-oriented synthesis in revealing promising therapeutic targets.;"Bastien, Jessica; Bittker, Joshua A.; Brancucci, Nicolas M.; Clarke, David; Comer, Eamon; Corey, Victoria; Derbyshire, Emily R.; Dornan, Gillian L.; Duffy, Sandra; Eckley, Sean; et al.,; Itoe, Maurice A.; Kato, Nobutaka; Koolen, Karin M.

Background: Malaria parasites go through major transitions during their complex life cycle, yet the underlying differentiation pathways remain obscure. Here we apply single cell transcriptomics to unravel the program inducing sexual differentiation in Plasmodium falciparum. Parasites have to make this essential life-cycle decision in preparation for human-to-mosquito transmission.Methods: By combining transcriptional profiling with quantitative imaging and genetics, we defined a transcriptional signature in sexually committed cells.Results: We found this transcriptional signature to be distinct from general changes in parasite metabolism that can be observed in response to commitment-inducing conditions.Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study provides a template to capture transcriptional diversity in parasite populations containing complex mixtures of different life-cycle stages and developmental programs, with important implications for our understanding of parasite biology and the ongoing malaria elimination campaign.;"Birren, Bruce W; Brancucci, Nicolas M B; De Niz, Mariana; Marti, Matthias; Neafsey, Daniel E; Ravel, Deepali; Sollelis, Lauriane; Straub, Timothy J; Voss, Till S";10.17605/OSF.IO/QMXVZ;2018-05-31T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/qmxvz/;OSF;Probing Plasmodium falciparum sexual commitment at the single-cell level.;302F61B5-187F-4581-9BCE-27BB5F85B065;160975
Heterochromatin-dependent gene silencing is central to the adaptation and survival of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites, allowing clonally variant gene expression during blood infection in humans. By assessing genome-wide heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) occupancy, we present a comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin landscapes across different Plasmodium species, strains, and life cycle stages. Common targets of epigenetic silencing include fast-evolving multi-gene families encoding surface antigens and a small set of conserved HP1-associated genes with regulatory potential. Many P. falciparum heterochromatic genes are marked in a strain-specific manner, increasing the parasite's adaptive capacity. Whereas heterochromatin is strictly maintained during mitotic proliferation of asexual blood stage parasites, substantial heterochromatin reorganization occurs in differentiating gametocytes and appears crucial for the activation of key gametocyte-specific genes and adaptation of erythrocyte remodeling machinery. Collectively, these findings provide a catalog of heterochromatic genes and reveal conserved and specialized features of epigenetic control across the genus Plasmodium.;"Bártfai, Richárd; Bozdech, Zbynek; Brancucci, Nicolas M.B.; Christensen, Peter R.; Filarsky, Michael; Fraschka, Sabine A.; Hoo, Regina; Huang, Ximei; Marti, Matthias; Mohring, Franziska; Moon, Robert W.; Mushunje, Annals T.; Niederwieser, Igor; Nosten, Francois; Preiser, Peter R.; Russell, Bruce; Voss, Till S.; Yam, Xue Yan";10.1016/j.chom.2018.01.008;2018-03-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102695;Gene Expression Omnibus;Comparative Heterochromatin Profiling Reveals Conserved and Unique Epigenome Signatures Linked to Adaptation and Development of Malaria Parasites;5BECAD03-A2CF-4B18-80EF-8B6CB24D4F1A;160975
"Australia’s response to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pandemic led to effective control of HIV transmission and one of the world’s lowest HIV incidence rates-0.14%. Although there has been a recent decline in new HIV diagnoses in New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state in Australia, there has been a concomitant increase with non-B subtype infections, particularly for the HIV-1 circulating recombinant form CRF01_AE. This aforementioned CRF01_AE sampled in NSW, were combined with those sampled globally to identify NSW-specific viral clades. The population growth of these clades was assessed in two-year period intervals from 2009 to 2017. Overall, 109 NSW-specific clades were identified, most comprising pairs of sequences; however, five large clades comprising ≥10 sequences were also found. Forty-four clades grew over time with one or two sequences added to each in different two-year periods. Importantly, while 10 of these clades have seemingly discontinued, the remaining 34 were still active in 2016/2017. Seven such clades each comprised ≥10 sequences, and are representative of individual sub-epidemics in NSW. Thus, although the majority of new CRF01_AE infections were associated with small clades that rarely establish ongoing chains of local transmission, individual sub-epidemics are present and should be closely monitored.";"Bachmann, Nadine; Carrera, Alex; Cooper, Craig; Di Giallonardo, Francesca; Duchêne, Sebastián; Dwyer, Dominic E.; Grulich, Andrew E.; Holden, Joanne; Holmes, Edward C.; Keen, Phillip; Kelleher, Anthony D.; Lee, Frederick J.; Pinto, Angie N.; Price, Karen; Salem, Hanan; Selvey, Christine; Shaik, Ansari; Telfer, Barbara";MK941065-MK941134;2019-05-27T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK941065;NCBI;Limited Sustained Local Transmission of HIV-1 CRF01_AE in New South Wales, Australia;C16E1467-385D-4CFD-B125-04295445980D;174462

Lipid droplets (LDs) are the major lipid storage organelles of eukaryotic cells and a source of nutrients for intracellular pathogens. We demonstrate that mammalian LDs are endowed with a protein-mediated antimicrobial capacity, which is up-regulated by danger signals. In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), multiple host defense proteins, including interferon-inducible guanosine triphosphatases and the antimicrobial cathelicidin, assemble into complex clusters on LDs. LPS additionally promotes the physical and functional uncoupling of LDs from mitochondria, reducing fatty acid metabolism while increasing LD-bacterial contacts. Thus, LDs actively participate in mammalian innate immunity at two levels: They are both cell-autonomous organelles that organize and use immune proteins to kill intracellular pathogens as well as central players in the local and systemic metabolic adaptation to infection.;"Bosch, Marta; Bozza, Patricia T.; Campo, Rocío; Català, Cristina; Curson, James E.

Transmission represents a population bottleneck in the Plasmodium life cycle and a key intervention target of ongoing efforts to eradicate malaria. Sexual differentiation is essential for this process, as only sexual parasites, called gametocytes, are infective to the mosquito vector. Gametocyte production rates vary depending on environmental conditions, but external stimuli remain obscure. Here, we show that the host-derived lipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) controls P. falciparum cell fate by repressing parasite sexual differentiation. We demonstrate that exogenous LysoPC drives biosynthesis of the essential membrane component phosphatidylcholine. LysoPC restriction induces a compensatory response, linking parasite metabolism to the activation of sexual-stage-specific transcription and gametocyte formation. Our results reveal that malaria parasites can sense and process host-derived physiological signals to regulate differentiation. These data close a critical knowledge gap in parasite biology and introduce a major component of the sexual differentiation pathway in Plasmodium that may provide new approaches for blocking malaria transmission.;"Adams, John H; Adapa, Swamy R; Blancke Soares, Alexandra; Boltryk, Sylwia D; Bopp, Selina; Brancucci, Nicolas M B; Clardy, Jon; Clark, Martha A; Conejo-Garcia, Ana; De Niz, Mariana; Demas, Allison; Duraisingh, Manoj T; Gendaszewska-Darmach, Edyta; Gerdt, Joseph P; Grüring, Christof; Hitz, Eva; Jiang, Rays H Y; Laffitte, Marie-Claude; Marti, Matthias; Niederwieser, Igor; Philip, Nisha; Ravel, Deepali; Rubio-Ruiz, Belén; Voss, Till S; Wang, ChengQi; Waters, Andrew P; Wirth, Dyann F; Zhang, Min";200104114;2017-12-14T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104114;Gene Expression Omnibus;Lysophosphatidylcholine Regulates Sexual Stage Differentiation in the Human Malaria Parasite Plasmodium falciparum.;55378C82-790D-4A4B-A3DD-EF487D6B97AB;160975

"The development of safe, efficacious vaccines to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic is an issue of global public concern.  A clearer picture of who has invested, how much, when, and where, is critical to understand better the distribution of risks and potential rewards, to shed light on how R&D investments may influence who gets access to the vaccines that result, and to inform future approaches to vaccine R&D.We have gathered data from different publicly available sources on investments for COVID-19 vaccines R&D. In addition, in order to estimate the magnitude of the advanced purchase agreements (APAs) signed between countries and pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the development of COVID-19 vaccines, we have used the data from our COVID-19 Vaccine Access dataset.A selection of visualizations summarizing the data are presented below; the full dataset is available for download here, along with its associated README file.";"Agarwal, Surabhi; Alonso Ruiz, Adrian; Bezruki, Anna; Moon, Suerie; Vieira, Marcela";n/a;2022-02-10T00:00:00Z;https://da7af2c8-d9b0-47a3-a3f6-89c3c3bfa02c.filesusr.com/ugd/356854_3ec3468c9c3d484e8914288896abfffb.xlsx?dn=COVID19RnDinvestments.xlsx;Knowledge Portal on Innovation and Access to Medicines;Covid-19 Vaccine R&D Investments;324A3D48-B27B-47F9-A624-CD5F17F18469;179842

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a major challenge in neonatology. Little is known about NEC pathophysiology apart from the presence of pre-event gut dysbiosis. Here, we applied broad range metabolomics to stools obtained 1-5 days before NEC developed from 9 cases (9 samples) and 19 (32 samples) controls matched for gestational age at birth and birth weight. The 764 identified metabolites identified six pathways that differ between cases and controls. We pursued sphingolipid metabolism because cases had decreased ceramides and increased sphingomyelins compared to controls, and because of the relevance of sphingolipids to human inflammatory disorders. Targeted analysis of samples from 23 cases and 46 controls confirmed the initial broad range observations. While metabolites provided only 73% accuracy of classification by machine learning, hierarchical clustering defined a sphingolipid associated grouping that contained 60% of the cases but only 13% of the controls, possibly identifying a pathophysiologically distinct subset of NEC. The clustering did not associate with any of the analyzed clinical and sample variables. We conclude that there are significant changes in sphingolipid metabolism components in pre-NEC stools compared to controls, but our data urge circumspection before using sphingolipids as broadly applicable predictive biomarkers.;"Jiang, X; Ory, D S; Rusconi, B; Sidhu, R; Tarr, P I; Warner, B B";30030452;2018-07-20T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6054655/;PMC;Gut Sphingolipid Composition as a Prelude to Necrotizing Enterocolitis.;608C6578-BF93-4247-BEC5-D3C505B7A719;171556

"Organo-mineral associations play an important role in both the retention and accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC). Recent studies have demonstrated a strong link between calcium (Ca) and SOC in a range of soil types. However, the literature a current paradigm suggests that Ca-mediated accumulation of SOC is predominantly constrained to soils with calcium carbonates (pH > 6). Here we investigated the interaction between SOC and Ca in the acidic soils of Point Reyes, California using a suite of standard and advanced  soil characterisation methods. Both Ca and SOC content were high  in our samples and were closely correlated in multivariate analyses of our classical characterisation dataset. Linear combination fitting of the Ca K-edge XANES data revealed that Ca was predominantly associated with organic matter at our site. Additionally, STXM analysis showed that Ca had a strong spatial correlation with C; indeed, the C correlation with Ca was higher than the C correlation with Fe, presenting a higher spatial correlation between Ca-C than Fe-C.  Aromatic and double-bonded alkyl C dominated the C spectra associated with Ca, which differed from those associated with Fe or Fe-Ca-C,  with higher peaks in the aromatic and double-bonded alkyl C regions. These spectral features are consistent with published spectra of C with a lignin-like nature character and were observed in our soil samples obtained from up to 70 cm depths. Our data suggest that the Ca-C association may enhance the preservation of lignin-like degradation products, even at depth in acidic grassland soils with no carbonate . These observations challenge the existing paradigm (Rowley et al., 2018)  that Ca association is limited to soils with a pH > 6.5 .";Rowley, Mike;http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2440-7855;;https://ess-dive.lbl.gov/;Data will be made freely available through the ESSDIVE website;"Association between soil organic carbon and calcium in acidic grassland soils from Point Reyes National Seashore, CA.

AbstractProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a sliding clamp that acts as a central co-ordinator for mismatch repair (MMR) as well as DNA replication. Loss of Elg1, the major subunit of the PCNA unloader complex, causes over-accumulation of PCNA on DNA and also increases mutation rate, but it has been unclear if the two effects are linked. Here we show that timely removal of PCNA from DNA by the Elg1 complex is important to prevent mutations. Although premature unloading of PCNA generally increases mutation rate, the mutator phenotype of elg1Δ is attenuated by PCNA mutants PCNA-R14E and PCNA-D150E that spontaneously fall off DNA. In contrast, the elg1Δ mutator phenotype is exacerbated by PCNA mutants that accumulate on DNA due to enhanced electrostatic PCNA-DNA interactions. Epistasis analysis suggests that PCNA over-accumulation on DNA interferes with both MMR and MMR-independent process(es). In elg1Δ, over-retained PCNA hyper-recruits the Msh2-Msh6 mismatch recognition complex through its PCNA-interacting peptide motif, causing accumulation of MMR intermediates. Our results suggest that PCNA retention controlled by the Elg1 complex is critical for efficient MMR: PCNA needs to be on DNA long enough to enable MMR, but if it is retained too long it interferes with downstream repair steps.;"Gaubitz, Christl; Kelch, Brian A";6D0R;2019-07-26T00:00:00Z;http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?tabtoshow=Current&qrid=9652185D;RCSB PDB;Structure of a DNA retention-prone PCNA variant;5A14C091-FC58-42BD-9730-0F446A14CCB3;177859
BiVib is an extensive piano sample library consisting of binaural sounds and keyboard vibration signals.Samples were acquired with high-quality audio and vibration measurement equipment on two Yamaha Disklavier pianos (one grand and one upright model) by means of computer-controlled playback of each key at ten different MIDI velocity values.Project files (instruments and multis) are provided for use with the free software sampler Native Instruments Kontakt Player (version 5 and above, available for Windows and Mac OS).The nominal specifications of the equipment used in the acquisition chain are reported in a companion document, allowing researchers to calculate physical quantities (e.g. acoustic pressure, vibration acceleration) from the recordings.The library is especially suited for acoustic and vibration research on the piano, as well as for research on multimodal interaction with musical instruments.;"Avanzini, Federico; Fontana, Federico; Papetti, Stefano";BiVib zenodo;2019-02-19T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1213210;zenodo;BiVib - Audio-Tactile Piano Sample Library;B82C49EF-F3AA-44F9-B1D6-C15083A42823;178972

"A narrative act is a linguistic form that represents a complex action which has a secondary action.For example : Marc encourages Mary to study hard. «To encourage» is the complex action and «To study hard» is the secondary action. A narrative act is characterized by :    A predicate form : this is very useful because when a narrative act is coded, it's coded with its predicate form (for more information, see predicate form). For example : Encourage(X, Y, a)    Number of involved characters : this attribute represents the number of characters that are involved when the action is executed. It represents the number of active subjects. Example : Marc tells Mary that July is beautiful.Here Marc and Mary are the only involved characters    A type : the type defines if the narrative act is an action about an action (AA), an action about a state (AS), a state about an action (SA) or a state about a state (SS)    A sequence position : the sequence position corresponds to the position of the principal action related to the secondary action. It can be before, during or after.    A level of abstraction : this attribute corresponds to the complexity of the sentence.    Valence : valence is a linguistic characteristic of a verb. It corresponds to the number of elements that are connected to that verb. The element can be active or passive. A verb can be avalent (for example : to rain) and it can have a different valence according to how it is used (for example : He gives a gift (v=1). He gives a gift to her (v=2))    A domain and a Class : a narrative act is classified in domains and classes.

The role of energy storage is subject to intense debates at the national and international level, reflecting a lack of consensus about the techno-economic potential and respective merits of the various energy storage technologies. This is largely due to the wide spectrum of possible applications, evolving technology and unclear market conditions. In the context of the SwissStore project we studied energy storage in different contexts and from different perspectives, i.e.• in households, in combination with photovoltaic panels (coupled with batteries and thermal storage), taking the perspective of the private investor• in all buildings (all sectors, also with PV), with a focus on increased short-term flexibility, thereby also considering other strategies next to storage (e.g. demand-side response) and taking the perspective of the social planner.In both cases, optimisation frameworks were developed for Switzerland and different scenarios were studied for the next decades.;"Meier, Marco; Ramirez, Hector; Rinaldi, Arthur; Schroeteler, Benjamin";DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6782179;2022-06-30T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/6782179;Zenodo;The role of energy storage technologies in the context of the Swiss energy transition (SwissStore);241CDE03-178F-4B5A-904B-1AF240660418;172703

This data description contains only the list of interviews (gender and function of interviewee, date, type, duration, place of interview). This research project is characterized by an anthropological approach which makes data sharing difficult, in specific due to the situated, informal and highly personal production of data through intersubjective interactions and the fact that a part of our population is vulnerable. We need to guarantee protection for the people with whom we work, and sharing interview manuscripts (containing mainly biographical information) would raise severe issues in terms of confidentiality. We therefore can not share interview transcripts.;Dahinden, Janine;https://doi.org/10.48573/8fzg-5612;;https://doi.org/10.48573/8fzg-5612;Swiss UBase;Meta data MMP;E2AC0D01-8D65-48FE-B312-C47F944C7543;188024
Ambitious initiatives to coordinate genome sequencing of Earth’s biodiversity mean that the accumulation of genomic data is growing rapidly. In addition to cataloguing biodiversity, these data provide the basis for understanding biological function and evolution. Accurate and complete genome assemblies offer a comprehensive and reliable foundation upon which to advance our understanding of organismal biology at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. However, ever-changing sequencing technologies and analysis methods mean that available data are often heterogeneous in quality. In order to guide forthcoming genome generation efforts and promote efficient prioritisation of resources, it is thus essential to define and monitor taxonomic coverage and quality of the data.Here we present an automated analysis workflow that surveys genome assemblies from the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), assesses their completeness using the relevant Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologue (BUSCO) datasets, and collates the results into an interactively browsable resource. We apply our workflow to produce a community resource of available assemblies from the phylum Arthropoda, the Arthropoda Assembly Assessment Catalogue. Using this resource, we survey current taxonomic coverage and assembly quality at the NCBI, we examine how key assembly metrics relate to gene content completeness, and we compare results from using different BUSCO lineage datasets.These results demonstrate how the workflow can be used to build a community resource that enables large-scale assessments to survey species coverage and data quality of available genome assemblies, and to guide prioritisations for ongoing and future sampling, sequencing, and genome generation initiatives.;"Feron, Romain; Waterhouse, Robert";10.5524/100974;2022-01-05T00:00:00Z;http://gigadb.org/dataset/100974;GigaDB;"Supporting data for ""Assessing species coverage and assembly quality of rapidly accumulating sequenced genomes""";D7229D9D-8CE3-4E71-94FB-89B32E14AE6C;170664

The multimodal dataset VEPCON follows the BIDS standard and provides raw data of high-density EEG, structural MRI and diffusion weighted images (DWI) recorded in 20 participants and derivatives.Visual evoked potentials were recorded while participants discriminated briefly presented faces from scrambled faces, or coherently moving stimuli from incoherent ones. MRI and DWI were recorded in a separate session from the same participants.The dataset contains pre-processed EEG of single trials in each condition, behavioral measures, structural MRIs, individual brain parcellations at 5 spatial resolutions (66 to 998 regions), and corresponding structural connectomes based on fiber count, fiber density, average fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps. In addition, we provide EEG inverse solutions for source imaging based on individual anatomy, and Python and Matlab code for deriving time-series of activity in each brain region, at each parcellation level.This dataset can contribute to multimodal methods development, studying structure-function relations, as well as unimodal optimization of source imaging and graph analysis, among many other possibilities.;"Carboni, Margherita; Hagmann, Patric; Pascucci, David; Plomp, Gijs; Rué-Queralt, Joan; Tourbier, Sebastien";10.18112/openneuro.ds003505.v1.0.1;;https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003505/versions/1.0.1;OpenNeuro;VEPCON: Source imaging of high-density visual evoked potentials with multi-scale brain parcellations and connectomes;0689754F-1482-43BE-A6F7-8F5803274475;190065

This lexicon was developed in the context of measuring 'openness of communication” in the paper named ''Predicting Openness of Communication in Families with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome: Natural Language Processing Analysis''. To develop an 'openness of communication” score we built a lexicon containing words and phrases linked to communication and we classified them as positive or negative. The lexicon contains 532 items (132 unigrams, 215 bigrams, 185 trigrams). Two people independently created the scoring of N-grams in the lexicon as positive or negative.

These data were generated as part of a Swiss National Science Foundation funded visitor exchange program with the Optics Laboratory at EPFL on imaging through biofibers. One of the types of material studied was deep eutectic solvent assisted poly(polyol-co-citrate) polymers (DES citrate polymers). These are transparent, enabling possible application in optics, flexible, and have been shown to be biocompatible.DES-poly(polyol-co-citrate) polymers require several days cross linking time (curing time), typically 10 days at 80oC to become gel like materials. The aim here is to understand their mechnical properties as a function of curing time to obtain materials optimally matched to the mechanical properties of biological tissue with a view towards implants. The AFM files published here contain data on Young's modulus, adhesion, and dissipation for samples cured for different numbers of days, as well as the corresponding topography images.Associated FTIR spectra for the DES poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) samples are included.The AFM data were recorded using Peak Force QNM on a Bruker FastScan AFM in the EPFL Center of MicroNanoTechnology;"Cronin-Golomb, Mark; Psaltis, Demetri";https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4944883;2021-06-14T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4944883;Zenodo;Mechanical properties of deep eutectic solvent assisted poly(polyol-co-citrate) polymers;130BDE3E-1D86-4126-988F-8F57464FD1D8;198804

"CASP13 provides an independent mechanism for the assessment of methods of protein structure modeling. From May through July 2018, CASP organizers had been posting on this website sequences of unknown protein structures for modeling. Protein models were collected from May through mid-August, and evaluated as the experimental coordinates became available. In the Summer and Fall, the tens of thousands of models submitted by approximately 100 research groups worldwide were processed and evaluated. Independent assessors in each of the prediction categories bring objectivity, balance, and independent insight to this process and discussed their results at the assessors meeting ""Workshop on Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction Techniques"" in Basel. The results of the experiment were first made public immediately before the CASP Conference in December.All CASP predictions and assessment data are freely available at the Protein Structure Prediction Center.

Emotions stimulate and shape entrepreneurial alertness. In a first U.S.-based study, we analyzed self-reports of entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs by measuring differences in valence in emotions using the frequently applied Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scale for trait affectivity. In a second study, we explored 28,478 tweets of 185 successful entrepreneurs and 264 non-entrepreneurs (both drawn from Forbes lists) from 2009 to 2021, categorizing their tweeted words into positive and negative based on the Harvard IV-4 dictionary. While the model of Study 1 stresses that examples of positiveness, such as interested, excited, enthusiastic, and inspired, facilitate entrepreneurial alertness levels, which in turn accelerate levels of entrepreneurial discovery, Study 2's sentiment analysis highlights the significant difference between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs’ word usage-successful entrepreneurs tend to use more positive words in their tweets than successful non-entrepreneurs. Our results aim to inform and inspire entrepreneurial educators, policymakers, and (potential) entrepreneurs regarding how positiveness shapes entrepreneurial alertness, which promotes the discovery of potential new business ideas.;Fellnhofer, Katharina;https://osf.io/f9sjm/;2022-12-01T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/f9sjm/;" Open Science Framework (OSF) ";Twitter Discovery;047C38FF-A958-4C0B-996F-A052461DF301;180459

BirdLife Australia’s Atlas data are collected by skilled birdwatchers at sites they choose, with exact coordinates recorded for each survey. Bird surveys are carried out during the austral breeding season using the “2-ha, 20 min” method. This census method involves searching for birds in a two-hectare plot for 20 minutes. During this period, the volunteer records the geographical reference at the centre of their plot and all birds seen or heard in their survey area, including those flying overhead.

"The nutritional diversity of resources can affect the adaptive evolution of consumer metabolism and consumer diversification. The omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) have a high potential to affect consumer fitness, through their widespread effects on reproduction, growth, and survival. However, few studies consider the evolution of fatty acid metabolism within an ecological context. In the paper associated with this dataset, we document the extensive diversity in both primary producer and consumer fatty acid distributions among major ecosystems, between habitats, and among species within habitats. This dataset on fatty acid composition on primary producers and consumers from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems is used to create Figure 2 in the paper.

The topics and research questions of the conference ranged from psycho acoustic to technological and philosophical approaches to an aspect of sound perception which is sometimes called a “multidimensional dimension”. The fundamental categories of tone, colour, space, time and movement seem to evaporate when we try to fathom their essence. Derived notions such as time space, timbre (“sound colour”), hue (“colour tone”), tonal space and space-time are therefore not spared ambiguities and vagueness either. Whereas spatial models for pitch (“tone height”) have a long history, to date no reliable spaces for timbre could be established unequivocally. Although the timbre space metaphor conjectured by John Grey and the visualisations from his writings (1977/1978) are depicted in many introductions to musical acoustics, timbre is far from being a universally valid spatial feature of musical sounds.;"Albersheim, Gerhard; Czedik-Eysenberg, Isabella; Mannone, Maria; Muzzulini, Daniel; Oehler, Michael; Reuter, Christoph; Saitis, Charalampos; Siddiq, Saleh; Siedenburg, Kai";http://doi.org/10.17616/R3W21X;2023-03-21T00:00:00Z;https://medienarchiv.zhdk.ch/sets/scs_timbre-topologies;Medienarchiv der Zürcher Hochschule der Künste;Timbre Topologies - Perceptual and Conceptual Spaces;E2852874-71F1-43CF-8ED0-DA731E4E64F3;215589

Hydrogels were prepared by esterification of chitosan (Cs) with monochloroacetic acid to produce CMCs which was then crosslinked to HEC using citric acid as the crosslinking agent. To impart a stimuli responsiveness property to the hydrogels, polydiacetylene-zinc oxide (PDA-ZnO) nanosheets were synthesized in-situ during the crosslinking reaction followed by photopolymerization of the resultant composite. First, 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) head groups were stabilized with ZnO nanoparticles in the presence of CMCs-HEC hydrogels in petroleum ether. This was followed by irradiating the composite with Uv radiation to photopolymerize the PCDA to PDA within the hydrogel matrix so as to impart thermal and pH responsiveness to the hydrogel;"Fromm, Katharina; Gachanja,  Anthony; Kareru,  Patrick; Madivoli, Edwin; Schwarte , Justine";10.5281/zenodo.7500539;2023-01-03T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7500539;Zenodo;Stimuli Responsive and Antimicrobial Cellulose-Chitosan Hydrogels Containing Polydiacetylene Nanosheets;AAF1795F-9E1D-4D35-AEB5-6BEB35789C73;200290

New methods of big data analysis, data mining, data generations and data adaptation are widely used in many different areas of the modern society. This is mostly a result of fruitful cooperation between corresponding business experts and experts in relevant areas of the computing science. Natural sciences however, especially those frontiers like particle physics and cosmology at their extremes usually use different model: modern CS ideas are accommodated by specialists educated in the natural science, not by CS experts. In the presentation I will discuss pro and contra of this approach, give an overview which kind of problems may be better addressed using Machine Learning techniques. What may be expected when people apply ML to natural sciences, and which questions are still opened. We will also touch some ethical aspects related with increasing use of AI in modern world.;Ratnikov, Fedor;https://indico.cern.ch/event/683496/contributions/3100692/;2018-08-22T00:00:00Z;https://indico.cern.ch/event/683496/contributions/3100692/;Indico tool;Machine Learning: From Industry to Science;F597852A-FB0D-4B69-8DBC-80B97FA78712;182889

The Trireme framework is a tool for automatically exploring hierarchical multi-level parallelism for domain specific hardware acceleration. Trireme identifies and selects HW accelerators directly from the application source files, while suggesting parallelism-related optimizations (Task Level, Loop Level and Pipeline Parallelism). It is built within LLVM9 compiler infrastructure and consists of Analysis Passes that estimate Software (SW) latency, Hardware (HW) latency, Area and I/O requirements. Subsequently, an exact selection algorithm selects the subset of HW accelerators that maximizes performance (speedup) under a user defined area (HW resources) budget.;Zacharopoulos, Georgios;https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/387511771;2021-11-09T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/GiorgioZacharo/Trireme;Trireme;Trireme tool-chain;A22AA239-D2F8-4DA6-9E88-FE4BA3E0E2A7;191497

"Silicon is a beneficial element for many plants, and is deposited in plant tissue as amorphous bio-opal (phytoliths). The biochemical processes of uptake and precipitation induce isotope fractionation: the mass-dependent shift in the relative abundances of the stable isotopes of silicon. At the bulk scale, the silicon isotope composition reported as δ30Si span from -2 to +6 ‰. To further constrain these variations, at the scale of individual phytolith fragments we applied in situ femtosecond laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (fsLA-MC-ICP-MS) to a set of 7 natural phytolith samples.Two phytoliths samples (Norway spruce Picea abies and European beech Fagus sylvatica L.) were extracted from the organic-rich topsoil horizon (O) of two studies sites in Germany (Beerenbusch, close to village Rheinsberg and Wildmooswald, in the southern Black Forest). The other five phytolith samples (bushgrass Calamagrostis epigejos, common reed Phragmites australis, common horsetail Equisetum arvense, annual and perennial rough horsetail Equisetum hyemale) were separated from plant materials.The individual phytolith fragments were analysed by fsLA-MC-ICP-MS and Si isotope results are reported in the δ-notation (delta) as permil deviation relative to NIST SRM610, which is isotopically indistinguishable from the reference material NBS28 (quartz NIST SRM8546 alias NBS28, δ29Si ≡ 0 and δ30Si ≡ 0). Raw data processing and background corrections were made according to the protocol described in Schuessler and von Blanckenburg (2014) that also involves application of several data rejection/acceptance criteria. Of these, the most important ones are that A) only 30/28Si and 29/28Si ratios are used for the calculation which deviate less than 3 standard deviation from the mean and B) only results which follow the mass-depended terrestrial fractionation line in a three-isotope-plot of δ29Si vs. δ30Si within analytical uncertainties and C) have a mass bias drift between the two bracketing standards of less than 0.30 ‰ in 30/28Si are accepted and reported in this study.Detailed description of the sample origin, preparation steps, and the measurement protocol can be found in Frick, D.

We extracted and modified partial data of the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition ExaminationSurvey (NHANES) available in the R package NHANES. NHANES is a series of studies which aimsat the assessment of health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States of America. The survey contains demographic, health and lifestyle variables as well as physicalmeasurements for each participant. We used demographic variables in this data set to create the clusters, whereas seven potential covariates were selected among physical measurements and health variables. Their choice is motivated by biomedical studies described in our arxiv document Claeskens, Reluga, and Sperlich (2021). Post-selection inference for linear mixed model parameters using the conditional Akaike information criterion. The response is log BMI. We omitted incomplete cases, obtaining a data set with m = 3009 units in n = 60 clusters with (m1, m60) = (2, 234) in the smallest and the biggest cluster respectively.Full data can be found under this link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHANES/index.html;Reluga, Katarzyna;None (paper we used this data for not yet accepted for publication);2022-01-12T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/KatarzynaReluga/postcAIC/tree/main/data;postcAIC;Extracted and modified data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;6CA4EDF2-271B-4666-9E37-057703FED36E;195898

Before environmental DNA (eDNA) can establish itself as a robust tool for biodiversity monitoring, comparison with existing approaches is necessary, yet is lacking for terrestrial mammals. Moreover, much is unknown regarding the nature, spread and persistence of DNA shed by animals into terrestrial environments, or the optimal experimental design for understanding these potential biases. To address some of these challenges, we compared the detection of terrestrial mammals using eDNA analysis of soil samples against confirmed species observations from a long-term (~9-yr) camera trapping study. At the same time, we considered multiple experimental parameters, including two sampling designs, two DNA extraction kits and two metabarcodes of different sizes. All mammals regularly recorded with cameras were detected in eDNA. In addition, eDNA reported many unrecorded small mammals whose presence in the study area is otherwise documented. A long metabarcode (≈220bp) offering a high taxonomic resolution, achieved a similar efficiency as a shorter one (≈70bp) and a phosphate buffer-based extraction gave similar results as a total DNA extraction method, for a fraction of the price. Our results support that eDNA-based monitoring should become a valuable part of ecosystem surveys, yet mitochondrial reference databases need to be enriched first.;Leempoel, Kevin;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2547d7wmf;2019-12-09T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2547d7wmf;Dryad;A comparison of eDNA to camera trapping for assessment of terrestrial mammal diversity;5D91A20E-C92C-4CFF-95F1-03447D22B561;175075

To evaluate a Californian coastal grassland prior to experimental warming and identify key parameters that predict its response to warming, we completed a multi-disciplinary characterisation of a micro-catena, traversing a grassland at Point Reyes. Our objective was to characterise the micro-catena, investigate the spatial and temporal co-variability between multidisciplinary variables using a novel data framework, and discuss the potential implications of future warming on the sloped site. To investigate surface dynamics, we used remotely sensed observations and quantified aboveground biomass, also measuring ecosystem CO2 flux at several locations above the catena. We also measured 5 soil cores with classic characterisation techniques, measured spatial and temporal changes in the subsurface hydrology and temperature, and completed a geophysical survey of the region, evaluating subsurface dynamics along the micro-catena. A novel framework was then used to combine these multi-disciplinary datasets, using a supervised statistical clustering of the landscape and different modelling approaches that combined the soil measurements with geophysical study. These approaches gave us both novel insights into sloped Californian coastal grasslands, how they could respond to future warming, and set out a framework for the combination of multidisciplinary datasets for the evaluation of elevational transects.;Rowley, Mike;http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2440-7855;;https://ess-dive.lbl.gov/;The data will be made freely available on ESSDIVE upon publication;"Characterisation of a Californian coastal grassland along a micro-catena, using a multidisciplinary approach to identify micro-scale heterogeneities and their potential influence on future warming.

For long term monitoring of CO2 in the atmosphere it is crucial that standard reference gas mixtures stored in high pressure aluminum cylinders, used to calibrate global measurements, remain stable over their whole time of use. This database contains 60 CO2 in whole air measurements of high pressure aluminum cylinders that were completely drained to determine the stability of the CO2 mole fraction over their lifetime. If temperature measurements of the regulator and the cylinder body are available they were added to the data set. A detailed explanation about the experiments and the data can be found in the corresponding publication.;"Kitzis, Duane; Schibig, Michael F.; Tans, Pieter P.";10.15138/G3263N;2018-10-10T00:00:00Z;https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/arc/?id=128;NOAA GMD Data Archive;Experiments with CO2-in-air reference gases in high-pressure aluminum cylinders;D2DC250B-643F-4173-81F0-5AD195FB403A;165376
SignificancePredicting stable polymorphs of molecular crystals remains one of the grand challenges of computational science. Current methods invoke approximations to electronic structure and statistical mechanics and thus fail to consistently reproduce the delicate balance of physical effects determining thermodynamic stability. We compute the rigorous ab initio Gibbs free energies for competing polymorphs of paradigmatic compounds, using machine learning to mitigate costs. The accurate description of electronic structure and full treatment of quantum statistical mechanics allow us to predict the experimentally observed phase behavior. This constitutes a key step toward the first-principles design of functional materials for applications from photovoltaics to pharmaceuticals.;"Engel, Edgar A.; Kapil, Venkat";https://github.com/venkatkapil24/data_molecular_fluctuations;2022-02-08T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/venkatkapil24/data_molecular_fluctuations;data_molecular_fluctuations;A complete description of thermodynamic stabilities of molecular crystals;4D707DA8-EEAC-43A7-8B94-207DCCE33113;191678

Climate shifts are key drivers of ecosystem change. Despite the critical importance of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean for global climate, the extent of climate-driven ecological change in this region remains controversial. In particular, the biological effects of changing sea ice conditions are poorly understood. We hypothesize that rapid postglacial reductions in sea ice drove biological shifts across multiple widespread Southern Ocean species. We test for demographic shifts driven by climate events over recent millennia by analyzing population genomic datasets spanning 3 penguin genera ( Eudyptes , Pygoscelis , and Aptenodytes ). Demographic analyses for multiple species (macaroni/royal, eastern rockhopper, Adélie, gentoo, king, and emperor) currently inhabiting southern coastlines affected by heavy sea ice conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) yielded genetic signatures of near-simultaneous population expansions associated with postglacial warming. Populations of the ice-adapted emperor penguin are inferred to have expanded slightly earlier than those of species requiring ice-free terrain. These concerted high-latitude expansion events contrast with relatively stable or declining demographic histories inferred for 4 penguin species (northern rockhopper, western rockhopper, Fiordland crested, and Snares crested) that apparently persisted throughout the LGM in ice-free habitats. Limited genetic structure detected in all ice-affected species across the vast Southern Ocean may reflect both rapid postglacial colonization of subantarctic and Antarctic shores, in addition to recent genetic exchange among populations. Together, these analyses highlight dramatic, ecosystem-wide responses to past Southern Ocean climate change and suggest potential for further shifts as warming continues.;"Alexander, Alana; Cherel, Yves; Clucas, Gemma V.; Cole, Theresa L.; Cuthbert, Richard; Dussex, Nicolas; Dutoit, Ludovic; Ellenberg, Ursula; et al.,; Fiddaman, Steven R.; Frugone, María José; Hart, Tom; Hiscock, Johanna; Houston, David; Jouventin, Pierre; Mattern, Thomas; Miller, Gary; Miskelly, Colin; Nolan, Paul; Polito, Michael J.; Quillfeldt, Petra; Ryan, Peter G.; Smith, Adrian; Tennyson, Alan J.

Seminal theories posit that social and physical suffering underlie partly-common representational code. It is unclear, however, if this shared information reflects a modality-specific component of pain, or alternatively a supramodal code for properties common to many aversive experiences (unpleasantness, salience, etc.). To address this issue, we conducted experiments involving social inclusion or exclusion. Following each gaming experience, a painful or disgusting stimulation of comparable unpleasantness were delivered. This design allows to assess whether the effect of social exclusion on subjective pain (as found in the literature) does generalize to other unpleasant painless experiences.;"Corrado, Corradi-Dell'Acqua; Lia, Antico";10.17605/OSF.IO/ZTY6R;2018-12-05T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/zty6r/;Open Science Framework;Responses to comparably-unpleasant pain and disgust stimulations following social exclusion;E7CC6C78-CF85-4830-9FB7-8FC98810FD5C;157424

SOX2 and OCT4 are pioneer transcription factors playing a key role in embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and differentiation. How temporal fluctuations in their expression levels bias lineage commitment is unknown. Here we generated knock-in reporter fusion ES cell lines allowing to monitor endogenous SOX2 and OCT4 protein fluctuations in living cells and to determine their impact on mesendodermal and neuroectodermal commitment. We found that small differences in SOX2 and OCT4 levels impact cell fate commitment in G1 but not in S phase. Elevated SOX2 levels modestly increased neuroectodermal commitment and decreased mesendodermal commitment upon directed differentiation. In contrast, elevated OCT4 levels strongly biased ES cells towards both neuroectodermal and mesendodermal fates. Using ATAC-seq on ES cells gated for different endogenous SOX2 and OCT4 levels, we found that high OCT4 levels increased chromatin accessibility at differentiation-associated enhancers. This suggests that small endogenous fluctuations of pioneer transcription factors can bias cell fate decisions by concentration-dependent priming of differentiation-associated enhancers.;"Friman, Elias; Suter, David";GSE126554;2019-09-23T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126554;GEO datasets;Endogenous fluctuations of OCT4 and SOX2 bias pluripotent cell fate decisions;80063FB4-F8A5-43A7-9083-8BF54AA18A82;144828

During development, morphogens provide extracellular cues allowing cells to select a specific fate by inducing complex transcriptional programs. The mating pathway in budding yeast offers simplified settings to understand this process. Pheromone secreted by the mating partner triggers the activity of a MAPK pathway, which results in the expression of hundreds of genes. Using a dynamic expression reporter, we quantified the kinetics of gene expression in single cells upon exogenous pheromone stimulation and in the physiological context of mating. In both conditions, we observed striking differences in the timing of induction of mating‐responsive promoters. Biochemical analyses and generation of synthetic promoter variants demonstrated how the interplay between transcription factor binding and nucleosomes contributes to determine the kinetics of transcription in a simplified cell‐fate decision system.;"Aymoz, Delphine; Pelet, Serge";https://doi.org/10.17867/10000114;2018-03-29T00:00:00Z;https://idr.openmicroscopy.org;IDR;Timing of gene expression in a cell‐fate decision system;9A12325A-78C2-4971-BFD4-49F739D4E07A;165844

Freshwater ecosystems rely on allochthonous resources. Integration of these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected based on our own experiments, non-native amphipod species generally had lower biomass-adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates. Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides and other chemicals additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple native and non-native species compared to unpolluted systems. While the meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown, would decline if native shredders are replaced by non-native heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native species coexist with non-native arrivals. Experiments which neglect the ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.;"Altermatt, Florian; Little, Chelsea J.";10.5061/dryad.78g8h50;2018-02-08T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.78g8h50;Dryad;Species turnover and invasion of dominant freshwater invertebrates alter biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship;F31A7D8B-81B8-4F23-97AB-AC7ABD7F9B34;179089
Global analyses of biodiversity consistently reveal recurrent patterns of species distributions worldwide. However, unveiling the specific mechanisms behind those patterns remains logistically challenging, yet necessary for reliable biodiversity forecasts. Here, we combine theory and experiments to investigate the processes underlying spatial biodiversity patterns in dendritic, river-like landscapes, iconic examples of highly threatened ecosystems. We used geometric scaling properties, common to all rivers, to show that the distribution of biodiversity in these landscapes fundamentally depends on how ecological selection is modulated across space: while uniform ecological selection across the network leads to higher diversity in downstream confluences, this pattern can be inverted by disturbances when population turnover (i.e., local mortality) is higher upstream than downstream. Higher turnover in small headwater patches can slow down ecological selection, increasing local diversity in comparison to large downstream confluences. Our results show that disturbance-mediated slowing down of competitive exclusion can generate a specific transient signature in terms of biodiversity distribution when applied over a spatial gradient of disturbance, which is a common feature of many river landscapes.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Gounand, Isabelle; Harvey, Eric";10.5061/dryad.pm4n81q;2018-11-26T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pm4n81q;Dryad;Disturbance reverses classic biodiversity predictions in river-like landscapes;67798AB6-309A-4679-BAEF-AC25B7F4442D;179089

H&E Images associated to the publcation MarrowQuant in Aging and Aplasia: A Digital Pathology Workflow For Quantification of Bone Marrow Compartments in Histological SectionsExperiment 1:MarrowQuant, a digital and quantitative pathology tool was used to quantify the different compartments within the bone marrow at different conditions, mainly aplasia and aging conditions. By using our tool, we can compare the skeletal map induced by lethal irradiation(aplasia), with longitudinal quantification of the “red-to-yellow-to-red” transition over 2 months (aging) in C57BL/6 mouse femurs and tibiae. Experiment 2:Aside from the Mouse H&E quantification, the current version of MarrowQuant was tested on a small set of H&E bone marrow biopsies from anonymised patients. The tool performs in a comparable way as compared to the gold standard (Pathologists’ scorings), but it needs many optimisations before validating at the level of the human bone marrow biopsies quantifications and in clinical context.;"Burri, Olivier; et, al.; Naveiras, Olaia; Sarkis, Rita; Tratwal, Josefine";IDR Study idr0096;2021-11-09T00:00:00Z;https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-2103;"Image Data Resource (IDR) ";MarrowQuant in Aging and Aplasia: A Digital Pathology Workflow For Quantification of Bone Marrow Compartments in Histological Sections;13628385-AB68-44CE-A7BC-ABFCAD076DF1;183725

Long-distance ranging is a crucial tool for both industrial and scientific applications. Laser-based distance metrology offers unprecedented precision making it the ideal approach for many deployments. In particular, dual-comb ranging is favorable due to its inherently high precision and sampling rate. To make high-performance long-range dual-comb LiDAR more accessible by reducing both cost and complexity, here we demonstrate a fiber-based dual-comb LiDAR frontend combined with a free-running diode-pumped solid-state dual-comb laser that allows for sub-µm measurement precision while offering a theoretical ambiguity range of more than 200 km. Our system simultaneously measures distance with the role of each comb interchanged, thereby enabling Vernier-based determination of the number of ambiguity ranges. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we measure the distance to a moving target over more than 10 m with sub-µm precision and high update rate, corresponding to a relative precision of 10 −7 . For a static target at a similar distance, we achieve an instantaneous precision of 0.29 µm with an update time of 1.50 ms. With a longer averaging time of 200 ms, we reach a precision of around 33 nm, which corresponds to a relative precision of about 3·10 −9 with a time-of-flight-based approach.;"Camenzind, Sandro L.; Fricke, Jacob F.; Keller, Ursula; Kellner, Jost; Phillips, Christopher R.; Pupeikis, Justinas; Willenberg, Benjamin";https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000574283;2022-09-26T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000574283;Research Collection ETH Zurich;Dynamic and precise long-distance ranging using a free-running dual-comb laser;92A90975-E7A0-4B9F-BAE7-61B487EE1B2D;203709
"We present a new type of dual optical frequency comb source capable of scaling applications to high measurement speeds while combining high average power, ultra-low noise operation, and a compact setup. Our approach is based on a diode-pumped solid-state laser cavity which includes an intracavity biprism operated at Brewster angle to generate two spatially-separated modes with highly correlated properties. The 15-cm-long cavity uses an Yb:CALGO crystal and a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror as an end mirror to generate more than 3 W average power per comb, below 80 fs pulse duration, a repetition rate of 1.03 GHz, and a continuously tunable repetition rate difference up to 27 kHz. We carefully investigate the coherence properties of the dual-comb by a series of heterodyne measurements, revealing several important features: (1) ultra-low jitter on the uncorrelated part of the timing noise; (2) the radio frequency comb lines of the interferograms are fully resolved in free-running operation; (3) we validate that through a simple measurement of the interferograms we can determine the fluctuations of the phase of all the radio frequency comb lines; (4) this phase information is used in a post-processing routine to perform coherently averaged dual-comb spectroscopy of acetylene ( C2H2 ) over long timescales. Our results represent a powerful and general approach to dual-comb applications by combining low noise and high power operation directly from a highly compact laser oscillator.";"Callegari, F.; Camenzind, S.

The non-destructive collection of ultrathin sections onto silicon wafers for post-embedding staining and volumetric correlative light and electron microscopy traditionally requires exquisite manual skills and is tedious and unreliable. In MagC introduced here, sample blocks are augmented with a magnetic resin enabling remote actuation and collection of hundreds of sections on wafer. MagC allowed the correlative visualization of neuroanatomical tracers within their ultrastructural volumetric electron microscopy context.;Templier, Thomas;10.7554/eLife.45696;2019-07-11T00:00:00Z;https://neurodata.io/data/templier2019/;Neurodata;MagC - Datasets 1 and 2;88462836-DCBC-466A-A905-75955F3C3D14;173825

AbstractSemiconductor saturable absorber mirrors (SESAMs) have enabled a wide variety of modelocked laser systems, which makes measuring their nonlinear properties an important step in laser design. Here, we demonstrate complete characterization of SESAMs using an equivalent time sampling apparatus. The light source is a free-running dual-comb laser, which produces a pair of sub-150-fs modelocked laser outputs at 1051 nm from a single cavity. The average pulse repetition rate is 80.1 MHz, and the full time window is scanned at 240 Hz. Cross-correlation between the beams is used to calibrate the time axis of the measurements, and we use a non-collinear pump-probe geometry on the sample. The measurements enable fast and robust determination of all the nonlinear reflectivity and recovery time parameters of the devices from a single setup, and show good agreement with conventional nonlinear reflectivity measurements. We compare measurements to a rate equation model, showing good agreement up to high pulse fluence values and revealing that the samples tested exhibit a slightly slower recovery at higher fluence values. Lastly, we examine the polarization dependence of the reflectivity, revealing a reduced rollover if cross-polarized beams are used or if the sample is oriented optimally around the beam axis.;"Keller, Ursula; Nussbaum-Lapping, Alexander; Phillips, Christopher R.; Pupeikis, Justinas; Willenberg, Benjamin";https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000527284;2022-02-19T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000527284;Research Collection ETH Zurich;Absolute SESAM characterization via polarization-resolved non-collinear equivalent time sampling;D8A555C0-FE66-493F-85C8-08BD95EDF869;203709
Single-cavity dual-comb lasers are a new class of ultrafast lasers that have a wide possible application space including pump-probe sampling, optical ranging, and gas absorption spectroscopy. However, to date, laser cavity multiplexing has usually come with a trade-off in laser performance or relative timing noise suppression. We present a method for multiplexing a single laser cavity to support a pair of noise-correlated modes. These modes share all intracavity components and take a near-common path, but do not overlap on any active elements. We implement the method with an 80-MHz laser delivering more than 2.4 W of average power per comb with sub-140-fs pulses. We reach sub-cycle relative timing jitter of 2.2 fs [20 Hz, 100 kHz]. With this multiplexing technique, we can implement slow feedback on the repetition rate difference Δ frep , enabling this quantity to be drift-free, have low jitter, and be adjustable-a key combination for practical applications that was lacking in prior single-cavity dual-comb systems.;"Benayad, A.; Camenzind, S.

We present a free-running 80-MHz dual-comb polarization-multiplexed solid-state laser which delivers 1.8 W of average power with 110-fs pulse duration per comb. With a high-sensitivity pump-probe setup, we apply this free-running dual-comb laser to picosecond ultrasonic measurements. The ultrasonic signatures in a semiconductor multi-quantum-well structure originating from the quantum wells and superlattice regions are revealed and discussed. We further demonstrate ultrasonic measurements on a thin-film metalized sample and compare these measurements to ones obtained with a pair of locked femtosecond lasers. Our data show that a free-running dual-comb laser is well-suited for picosecond ultrasonic measurements and thus it offers a significant reduction in complexity and cost for this widely adopted non-destructive testing technique.;"Audoin, Bertrand; Bauer, Carolin P.; Benayad, Abdelmjid; Bruno, Francois; Camenzind, Sandro L.; Camy, Patrice; Golling, Matthias; Hettich, Mike; Keller, Ursula; Nussbaum-Lapping, Alexander; Phillips, Christopher R.; Pupeikis, Justinas; Willenberg, Benjamin";https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000510144;2021-10-15T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000510144;Research Collection ETH Zurich;Picosecond ultrasonics with a free-running dual-comb laser;4A69F8FF-3AC2-4858-A061-536D8FD91049;203709
Single-cavity dual-combs comprise a rapidly emerging technology platform suitable for a wide range of applications like optical ranging, equivalent time sampling, and spectroscopy. However, it remains a challenging task to develop a dual-comb system that exhibits low relative frequency fluctuations to allow for comb line resolved measurements, while simultaneously offering high average power and short pulse durations. Here we combine a passively cooled and compact dual-comb solid-state oscillator with a pair of core-pumped Yb-fiber-based amplifiers in a master-oscillator power-amplifier (MOPA) architecture. The Yb:KYW oscillator operates at 250 MHz and uses polarization multiplexing for dual-comb generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a single-cavity dual-comb based on this gain material. As the pulse timing characteristics inherent to the oscillator are preserved in the amplification process, the proposed hybrid approach leverages the benefit of both the ultra-low noise solid-state laser and the advantages inherent to fiber amplifier systems such as straight-forward power scaling. The amplifier is optimized for minimal pulse broadening while still providing significant amplification and spectral broadening. We obtain around 1 W of power per output beam with pulses then compressed down to sub-90 fs using a simple grating compressor, while no pre-chirping or other dispersion management is needed. The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the radio-frequency comb teeth is 700 Hz for a measurement duration of 100 ms, which is much less than the typical repetition rate difference, making this passively stable source well-suited for indefinite coherent signal averaging via computational phase tracking.;"Camenzind, Sandro L.; Keller, Ursula; Nussbaum-Lapping, Alexander; Phillips, Christopher R.; Pupeikis, Justinas; Sevim, Tolga; Willenberg, Benjamin";https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000597085;2023-02-08T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000597085;Research Collection ETH Zurich;Free-running Yb:KYW dual-comb oscillator in a MOPA architecture;2E1F5BC1-6AA2-42A0-BD46-4FAD435A1843;203709

"Introduction Wrong and missed diagnoses contribute substantially to medical error. Can a prompt to generate alternative diagnoses (prompt) or a differential diagnosis checklist (DDXC) increase diagnostic accuracy? How do these interventions affect the diagnostic process and self-monitoring?Methods Advanced medical students (N = 90) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions to complete six computer-based patient cases: Group 1 (prompt) was instructed to write down all diagnoses they considered while acquiring diagnostic test results, and to finally rank them. Groups 2 and 3 received the same instruction plus a list of 17 differential diagnoses for the chief complaint of the patient. For half of the cases, the DDXC contained the correct diagnosis (DDXC+) and for the other half, it did not (DDXC-; counterbalanced). Group 4 (control) was only instructed to indicate their final diagnosis. Mixed-effects models were used to analyze results.Results Students using a DDXC that contained the correct diagnosis had better diagnostic accuracy, mean (standard deviation), 0.75 (0.44), compared to controls without a checklist, 0.49 (0.50), P < 0.001, but those using a DDXC that did not contain the correct diagnosis did slightly worse, 0.43 (0.50), P = 0.602. The number and relevance of diagnostic tests acquired were not affected by condition, nor was self-monitoring. However, participants spent more time on a case in the DDXC-, 4:20 minutes (2:36), P ≤ 0.001, and DDXC+ condition, 3:52 minutes (2:09), than in the control condition, 2:59 minutes (1:44), P ≤ 0.001.Discussion Being provided a list of possible diagnoses improves diagnostic accuracy compared with a prompt to create a differential diagnosis list, if the provided list contains the correct diagnosis. However, being provided a diagnosis list without the correct diagnosis did not improve and might have slightly reduced diagnostic accuracy. Interventions neither affected information gathering nor self-monitoring.";"Hautz, Stefanie C; Hautz, Wolf E; Kämmer, Juliane E; Schauber, Stefan K; Stroben, Fabian";DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/92SWT;2020-11-30T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/92swt/;OSF: Open Science Framework;Differential diagnosis checklists reduce diagnostic error differentially: a randomized experiment;59137E81-3A55-47CE-936A-B4740A61513F;187284

Planning can be implemented in modelling using either hard or gradual restrictions. Different studies have addressed the inclusion of spatial planning policies in land-use change modelling. However, the integration of zoning constraints is generally established as hard or Boolean-based restrictions (e.g., whether urban development is allowed or not), while not accounting for the spatial heterogeneity or gradual characteristics within planning zones (e.g., whether planning regulations allow low, medium or high urban density), though these could improve real patterns simulations in urban areas. We assume Spanish General Zoning plans were suitable to explore the integration of planning into land-change modelling as soft constrains because they define land-use intensities in the buildable zoning areas. In light of the above considerations, the overall aim of the study was to model urban land-use changes using a multi-scenario approach that integrates digitized zoning plans for the Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) of Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Zaragoza. The following specific objectives were addressed: i) to analyse the role of planning by defining three future scenarios that integrate digitized zoning plans and one scenario that assumes almost no planning intervention; ii) to introduce zoning constraints that reflect different degrees of urban densities; iii) to generate a transferable spatially-explicit modelling framework to integrate planning into land-use change simulations. Four future land-use demands scenarios were defined for the FUAs. Storylines were created considering probable development scenarios related to zoning plans, current Spanish legislation and sustainability goals defined along two axes: a high market-oriented vs. high planning-intervention axis, and an axis of short-term economic growth vs. long-term sustainable growth. The sustainable development scenario (S1) is characterized by low gross floor area (GFA) growth that is limited to areas that are currently under development according to zoning plans. The business-as-usual scenario (S2) is characterized by medium GFA growth in the range of on-going trends. The strong development scenario (S3) is characterized by high GFA growth rates. Growth is restricted to buildable areas without urbanization project designated in zoning plans. The unrestricted development scenario (S4) prioritizes a high degree of market liberalization characterized by high GFA growth that surpasses population demands. S4 follows a rapid economic growth pattern with almost no planning intervention. ###3. The data set “LUSzoning”. The dataset includes 16 .asc raster layers providing the simulated land-uses under four defined scenarios for Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Zaragoza Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) for 2030. The simulated raster layers were created using CLUMondo simulation framework and have a spatial resolution of 30m. The .asc layers name include the name of the FUA and scenario number. For example, the output from simulating the urban growth for the city of Zaragoza under Scenario 2 is named “Zaragoza_S2.tif”. Furthermore, a .txt file named “Legend.txt” includes the numeric value of the land-use and the category of land-use that represents to interpret the .asc raster layers. The name of the land-use classes is a reclassification of the Urban Atlas 2012 land-use classes within the four Spanish FUAs analyzed.Citation";"Domingo, Dario; Hersperger, Anna M; Palka, Gaetan";10.16904/envidat.236;2021-07-20T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/luszoning;envidat;" LUSzoning: Land-use simulations integrating zoning regulations in Spanish functional urban areas ";3E018390-7C34-46BC-B995-5BB549807B59;157789
The present dataset is part of the published scientific paper Zhao C, Weng Q, Hersperger A M. Characterizing the 3-D urban morphology transformation to understand urban-form dynamics: a case study of Austin, Texas, USA. Landscape and urban planning, 2020, 203:103881. The overall objective of this paper is to understand urban form dynamics in the Austin metropolitan area for the periods 2006-2011 and 2011-2016. The study also aims to understand to what extent the changes in the built environment (in terms of ‘efficient growth’ versus ‘inefficient growth’) from the 1990s to 2016 in the Austin metropolitan area corresponded with ‘compact and efficient growth’ planning policy documents. The UMT distribution can be found in the paper. The area of transitioning UMT was provided in Table 2 and Table 3 can be found in the Appendix of the paper. A protocol was developed to perform the content analysis of the strategic plans and gather the data. The detailed list of protocol items can be found in Appendix B of the paper. This study demonstrates the advantage of applying Lidar data to characterize 3-D urban morphology type (UMT) transition and understand its dynamics, which helps develop a comprehensive understanding of the urbanization process and provides a tool for planning intentions and policies evaluation on urban development over time. The UMT maps can be found in Appendix A of the paper. The Lidar point datasets and the 30 × 30 m National Land Cover Database (NLCD) are the two main data sources of UMT mapping. Lidar datasets were gathered from different projects that had been conducted and collected by state agencies and other organizations between 2007 and 2017. Table A1 in the appendix in the paper shows the accuracies and acquisition parameters of the Lidar projects from 2007 to 2017. Land use/cover dynamics in Austin metropolitan area dataset provides Land use/cover patterns in the years 1992, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016 with a spatial resolution of 30 meters.

In this talk, I’ll focus on an exceptional way of doing data-driven research employing networked community. Many examples of collaboration with the data-science community within competitions organised on Kaggle or Coda Lab platforms usually get limited by restrictions on those platforms. Common metrics do not necessarily correspond to the goal of the original research. Constraints imposed by the problem statement typically look artificial for ML-community. Preparing a perfect competition takes a considerable amount of efforts. On the contrary research process requires a lot of flexibility and ability to look at the problem from different angles. I’ll describe the alternative research collaboration process can bridge the gap between domain-specific research and data science community. Particularly, it can involve academic researchers, younger practitioners and all enthusiasts who are willing to contribute. Such research process can be supported by an open computational platform that will be described along with meaningful examples and discussed amongst the audience of the track.;Ustyuzhanin, Andrey;https://indico.cern.ch/event/683496/contributions/3100691/;2018-08-22T00:00:00Z;https://indico.cern.ch/event/683496/contributions/3100691/;Indico tool;Networked data-science for research, academic communities and beyond;928EFB70-1720-4743-8DAB-D55D5EDFC316;182889

CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells are essential for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing excessive immune responses. In the context of Th1 immune responses, co-expression of the Th1 transcription factor T-bet with Foxp3 is essential for Treg cells to control Th1 responses. T-bet-dependent expression of CXCR3 directs Tregs to the site of inflammation, however, the suppressive mediators enabling effective control of Th1 responses at this site are unknown. In this study, we determined the signature of CXCR3+ Treg cells arising in Th1 settings and defined universal features of Treg cells in this context using multiple Th1-dominated models. Our analysis defined a set of Th1-specific co-inhibitory receptors that are specifically expressed in Treg cells during Th1 immune responses. Among these, we identified the novel co-inhibitory receptor CD85k as a functional mediator of the enhanced suppression of Th1 effector cells by CXCR3+ Treg cells.;Robinson, Mark;E-MTAB-6156;2018-06-30T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6156/;ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI;CXCR3+ Treg cells suppress Th1-immune responses through expression of the co-inhibitory receptors CD85k and Lag-3;910FE861-353E-4787-8922-0052B242707E;150663

Globally, the geographical distributions of species are dynamic and strongly influenced by dispersal. At the same time, range dynamics feed back and may select for increased dispersal at expanding range fronts. This interplay between macroecological and evolutionary dynamics happens almost universally across environmental gradients and such gradients can have a direct impact on the fitness of organisms due to the match or mismatch between an individual's environmental optimum and the current conditions along the gradient. Importantly, gradients also provide individuals with information on environmental changes because dispersing individuals may sense whether environmental conditions improve or deteriorate. However, the ability of organisms to use this information on the environment and to subsequently adjust dispersal decisions plastically, that is, deciding to further disperse into the gradient or not, has been largely ignored and the macroecological consequences remain unclear. We here aim to demonstrate the impact of informed dispersal on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of ranges.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Nitsche, Nikolai";10.5061/dryad.113v9;2017-10-14T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.113v9;Dryad;Information use shapes the dynamics of range expansions into environmental gradients;F65B4631-0179-4E2A-B34E-9C7627CCF4B4;179089
Emotions are known to play central roles in radicalization, violent extremism, and conspiracy ideation. Of the emotions studied for their contribution to those social pathologies, envy has been relatively unexplored. We experimentally investigate the relationship between envy, radicalization and violent extremism, and conspiracy ideation. Envy is shown to have an impact on core aspects of radicalization, particularly the endorsement of extremism and the acceptance of violent means to achieve one’s ends. Radicalization might facilitate the adoption of conspiracy ideation, rather than the latter being a cause of radicalization. Some implications for future research on radicalization and violent extremism are discussed.;Moncrieff, Michael;DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/46FCJ;2022-11-29T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/46fcj/;OSFHOME;envy, Radicalization and Conspiracy;F24F2B17-AEE6-41D9-A8E3-03607B2CF983;176781

Abiotic stress is a major force of selection that organisms are constantly facing. While the evolutionary effects of various stressors have been broadly studied, it is only more recently that the relevance of interactions between evolution and underlying ecological conditions, that is, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, have been highlighted. Here, we experimentally investigated how populations adapt to pH-stress under high population densities. Using the protist species Tetrahymena thermophila, we studied how four different genotypes evolved in response to stressfully low pH conditions and high population densities. We found that genotypes underwent evolutionary changes, some shifting up and others shifting down their intrinsic rates of increase (r0). Overall, evolution at low pH led to the convergence of r0 and intraspecific competitive ability (α) across the four genotypes. Given the strong correlation between r0 and α, we argue that this convergence was a consequence of selection for increased density-dependent fitness at low pH under the experienced high density conditions. Increased density-dependent fitness was either attained through increase in r0 , or decrease of α, depending on the genetic background. In conclusion, we show that demography can influence the direction of evolution under abiotic stress.;"Altermatt, Florian; Arquint, Angelina; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Merkli, Stefanie; Moerman, Felix; Wagner, Andreas";10.5061/dryad.mpg4f4qvg;2019-12-17T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.mpg4f4qvg;Dryad;Evolution under pH stress and high population densities leads to increased density-dependent fitness in the protist Tetrahymena thermophila;2AF14340-5692-4BC0-BA29-E86421E3CF3D;179089

The FIRE: Feedback In Realistic Environments project seeks to develop and explore cosmological simulations of galaxy formation that directly resolve the interstellar medium of individual galaxies while capturing their cosmological environment. FIRE aims to improve the predictive power of galaxy formation simulations by directly informing the implementation of sub-resolution processes with explicit small-scale models, thus reducing the reliance on adjustable model parameters.The FIRE simulations are used to address a wide array of questions in galaxy formation and intergalactic medium science, including the regulation of galaxy growth by “feedback,” the properties of galactic inflows and outflows, the morphological transformation of galaxies, the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies and the need for active galactic nucleus feedback, the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies, and the effects of stellar feedback on dark matter halos.;Wetzel, Andrew;http://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/fire;2022-02-14T00:00:00Z;http://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/fire;FIRE-2 public data repository;FIRE-2 public data repository;C18D511D-E7F3-482C-8A84-F5209C31A68A;194814

We imaged in total 58 glioblastoma explants using CODEX technology with a 55-marker panel. The imaging data was segmented into single cells  based on best-focus nuclear staining using DAPI and DRAQ5 as reference. Spatial (X/Y/Z) coordinates can locate each cell within a specific slide. Cell type annotation was thereafter performed using both VORTEX clustering and manual supervision on the slides (refer to software package from the NOLAN lab, Stanford (https://github.com/nolanlab/CODEX). A previously established highly multiplexed tissue cytometry platform called CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) was re-engineered here here to create multidimensional imaging datasets of glioblastoma (GBM) bioreactor explants. In this procedure, DNA-barcoded antibodies bound to antigens present in the tissue were iteratively rendered visible by hybridizing complementary fluorescent DNA oligonucleotides. An algorithmic pipeline was used to process raw imaging data, segment and identify single cells and their localizations within tissues, and quantify their marker expression. Unsupervised clustering, followed by manual curation of clusters based on marker expression, morphology and tissue localization, was used to call out specific cell types. Expression of selected markers per cell were manually gated in CellEngine (https://cellengine.com). Cellular neighborhoods were algorithmically identified. We identified seven conserved, distinct tissue compartments (TCs) -a collection of components characteristic of the GBM iTME. This study provides a framework for interrogating how glioblastoma patients could potentially profit from local neoadjuvant immunotherapies.;Hutter, Gregor;f9hfcfyt93.1;2022-01-05T00:00:00Z;https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/f9hfcfyt93/1;Mendeley.com;GBM CODEX clustered Data;6928364B-A60D-4BDA-8566-22C17FB0A43A;176974

The number of human genomes being genotyped or sequenced increases exponentially and efficient haplotype estimation methods able to handle this amount of data are now required. Here we present a method, SHAPEIT4, which substantially improves upon other methods to process large genotype and high coverage sequencing datasets. It notably exhibits sub-linear running times with sample size, provides highly accurate haplotypes and allows integrating external phasing information such as large reference panels of haplotypes, collections of pre-phased variants and long sequencing reads. We provide SHAPEIT4 in an open source format and demonstrate its performance in terms of accuracy and running times on two gold standard datasets: the UK Biobank data and the Genome In A Bottle.;Delaneau, olivier;10.5281/zenodo.4078696;2019-12-28T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/odelaneau/shapeit4;SHAPEIT4;Accurate, scalable and integrative haplotype estimation;553F655C-46BD-44BC-9376-09B3B0C9AB18;176977

Healthcare providers often underestimate patients’ pain, sometimes even when aware of their reports. This could be the effect of experience reducing sensitivity to others pain, or distrust towards patients’ self-evaluations. Across multiple experiments (375 participants), we tested whether senior medical students differed from younger colleagues and lay controls in the way they assess people’s pain and take into consideration their feedback. We found that medical training affected the sensitivity to pain faces, an effect shown by the lower ratings and highlighted by a decrease in neural response of the insula and cingulate cortex. Instead, distrust towards the expressions’ authenticity affected the processing of feedbacks, by decreasing activity in the ventral striatum whenever patients’ self-reports matched participants’ evaluations, and by promoting strong reliance on the opinion of other doctors. Overall, our study underscores the multiple processes which might influence the evaluation of others’ pain at the early stages of medical career.This provide data and analysis code for the manuscript: Dirupo, G., Totaro, S., Richard, J., & Corradi-Dell'Acqua, C.

ChIP-seq experiments were performed for the gametocyte development protein 1 (PfGDV1, PF3D7_0935400) in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7. An inducible ectopic overexpression 3D7/PfGDV1-GFP-DD transgenic parasite line was created using the FKBP-destabilization domain Shield-1 system on an episomal expression plasmid. The resulting PfGDV1-GFP-DD transgenic parasite line was used in a comparative ChIP-sequencing time-course experiment. 3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDOFF parasites were split at 28-34 hours post-invasion (hpi), cultured in parallel in absence or presence of Shield-1 and paired chromatin samples were harvested two (TP1), six (TP2) and ten (TP3) hours after Shield-1 addition. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed using mouse anti-GFP (Roche Diagnostics, #11814460001). In parallel the effect of PfGDV1 overexpression on global PfHP1 occupancy was investigated ten hours (TP3) after Shield-1 addition using anti-rabbit PfHP1 (Brancucci et al. 2014). Additionally, directional RNA-seq was performed for Plasmodium falciparum F12 wildtype parasites and a gdv1-antisense RNA loss-of-function mutant parasite line (F12/gdv1-asKO) generated using CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing. F12 and F12/gdv1-asKO parasites were synchronized to obtain an eight hour growth window and were harvested at 32-40hpi and 40-48hpi;"Bártfai, Richárd; Brancucci, Nicolas M.

"Table of content: 1. Frequency of early concepts; 2. Frequency of additional concepts; 3. Use of any early concept; 4. Use of any additional concept, 5. Planning steps; 6. Protocol.The present dataset is part of the published scientific paper entitled “Landscape ecological concepts in planning: review of recent developments” (Hersperger et al., 2021). The goal of this research was to review recent publications to assess the use of landscape ecological concepts in planning. Specifically, we address the following research questions: Q1. Landscape ecological concepts: What are they? How frequently are they mentioned in current research? Q2. How are landscape ecological concepts integrated in landscape planning?We analysed all empirical and overview papers that have been published in four key academic journals in the field of landscape ecology and landscape planning in the years 2015-2019 (n = 1918). Four key journals in the field of landscape ecology were selected to conduct the analysis, respectively Landscape Ecology (LE), Landscape Online (LO), Current Landscape Ecology Reports (CLER), and Landscape and Urban Planning (LUP). The title, abstract and keywords of all papers were read in order to identify landscape ecological concepts. Then, all 1918 papers went through a keyword search to identify the use of early and additional concepts. We used the “pdfsearch” package in R programming language and searched for singular and plural forms and different variations of the concepts (see Supplementary material 1, Table A). As a result, we provided four outputs:  1. Frequency of early concepts. This data provides the total number of times each article used each early concept (Q1). This data was used to produce the Figure 2a at the original publication.  2. Frequency of additional concepts. This data provides the total number of times each article used each additional concept (Q1). This data was used to produce the Figure 2b at the original publication.  3. Use of any early concept. This data provides the total number of times each article used any early concept (Q1). This data was used to produce the Figure 3a at the original publication.  4. Use of any additional concept. This data provides the total number of times each article used any additional concept (Q1). This data was used to produce the Figure 3b at the original publication.To address the second question (Q2), the title, abstract and keywords of the papers included in our sample (n=1918 articles) were screened to identify papers that might show how landscape ecological concepts are integrated into planning. We selected 52 empirical papers (see Supplementary material - 4 Integration of landscape ecological concepts into planning), and we provided two outputs:  5. Planning steps. This data provides the number of times landscape ecological concepts were addressed in each planning steps in 52 empirical papers analysed in detail (Q2). This data was used to produce the Figure 4 at the original publication.  6. Protocol for assessing the integration of landscape ecological concepts into planning.

The Spoken CALL Shared Task is an initiative to create an open challenge dataset for speech-enabled CALL systems, jointly organised by the University of Geneva, the University of Birmingham, Radboud University and the University of Cambridge. The task is based on data collected from a speech-enabled online tool which has been used to help young Swiss German teens practise skills in English conversation. Items are prompt-response pairs, where the prompt is a piece of German text and the response is a recorded English audio file. The task is to label pairs as “accept” or “reject”, accepting responses which are grammatically and linguistically correct to match a set of hidden gold standard answers as closely as possible. Resources are provided so that a scratch system can be constructed with a minimal investment of effort, and in particular without necessarily using a speech recogniser.The first edition of the Shared Task was carried out in 2017, with results presented at the SLaTE 2017 workshop in Stockholm. The second edition, with improved training data and improved baseline recogniser resources, was carried out in 2018, results this time being presented at a special session of Interspeech 2018 in Hyderabad. Details, including full results and links to all the papers, are available from the Shared Task 1 site and the Shared Task 2 site.The third edition of the Shared Task will make available the same training data and resources as the second edition. There will be new test data. Given the strong results reported in the second edition, we are also making an important change: THE THIRD EDITION WILL USE A NEW METRIC. This new metric, Dfull, is defined in the instructions tab and motivated in §5 of the Interspeech 2018 overview paper. Unlike the metric used in the two previous editions of the Shared Task, which focused on optimizing performance for correct student responses (i.e. responses which should be accepted), Dfull places equal weight on correct and incorrect utterances. Since incorrect responses are considerably harder to process than correct ones, we expect Dfull to pose interesting new challenges.;"Baur, Claudia; Caines, Andrew; Chua, Cathy; Gerlach, Johanna; Rayner, Manny";Spoken CALL Shared Task, third edition;;https://regulus.unige.ch/spokencallsharedtask_3rdedition/;Spoken CALL Shared Task, third edition;Spoken CALL Shared Task, third edition;7DF909E8-0E17-4C26-9C84-C51AB13B0016;177065

Urban forestry & urban greening, 40, 17-28. The goal of this research was to conduct a comparative analysis of the integration of green infrastructure concept in strategic spatial plans of European Urban regions. Specifically, the paper has the following objectivs: 1) which principles of GI planning are followed in strategic plans of urban regions? 2) can we identify different approaches to GI integration into strategic planning?. The study focues on a sample consisting of 14 case studies spanning 11 countries. We retrieved the strategic plans from the websites of the planning authorities. The list of the reviewed planning documents can be found in Appendix A of the paper. A protocol was developed to perform the content analysis of the strategic plans and gather the data. The detailed list of protocol items can be found in Appendix B of the paper. The planning documents were read in order to address the protocol items. The answer to the protocol items in each of the first two categories (items 1-11) was documented as text, while the answer for the third category, namely items addressing the planning principles (items 12-36), was coded according to Table 1 of the article. As a result, we provide the folowing outputs: • GI_Dataset_1_Items_1-12.xlsx - available on request o Results of the coding on general aspects regarding the strategic plans of urban regions as well as extracts from each plan to justify the coding option - this data was derived from the coding procedure coresponding to items from 1 to 12 of the protocol.

"The present dataset is part of the published scientific paper entitled “The role of spatial planning in land change: An assessment of urban planning and nature conservation efficiency at the southeastern coast of Brazil” (Pierri Daunt, Inostroza and Hersperger, 2021). In this work, we evaluated the conformance of stated spatial planning goals and the outcomes in terms of urban compactness, basic services and housing provision, and nature conservation for different land-use strategies. We evaluate the 2005 Ecological-Economic Zoning (EEZ) and two municipal master plans from 2006 in a coastal region in São Paulo State, Brazil. We used Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM) to explain the relationship between the plan strategies and land-use change ten years after implementation in terms of urban compactness, basic services and housing increase, and nature conservation.We acquired the data for the explanatory variables from different sources listed on Table 1. Since the model is spatially explicit, all input data were transformed to a 30 m resolution raster. Regarding the evaluated spatial plans, we acquired the zones limits from the São Paulo State Environmental Planning Division (CPLA-SP), Ilhabela and Ubatuba municipality.    Land use and cover data: Urban persistence, Urban axial, Urban infill, Urban Isolates, Forest cover persistence, Forest cover gain, NDVI increaseWe acquired two Landsat Collection 1 Higher-Level Surface Reflectance images distributed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), covering the entire study area (paths 76 and 77, row 220, WRS-2 reference system, https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). We classified one image acquired by the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor on 2005-05-150, and one image from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor from 2015-08-15. We collected 100 samples for forest cover, 100 samples for built-up cover and 100 samples for other classes. We then classified these three classes of land cover at each image date using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised algorithm (Hsu et al., 2003), using ENVI 5.0 software.Land-use and land-cover changes from 2005 to 2015 were quantified using map algebra, by mathematically adding them together in pairs (10*LULC2015 + LULC2005). We reclassified the LULC data into forest gain (conversion of any 2005 LULC to forest cover in 2015); forest persistence (2005 forested pixels that remained forested in 2015); new built-up area (conversion of any 2005 LULC to built-up in 2015); and urban maintenance (2005 built-up pixels that remained built-up in 2015).To describe the spatial configuration of the urban expansion, we classified the new built-up areas into axial, infill and isolated, following Inostroza et al. (2013) (For details, please refer to Supplementary Material I at the original publication).The NDVI was obtained from the same source used for the LULC data. With the Google Engine platform, we used an annual average for the best pixels (without clouds) for 2005 and 2015, and we calculated the changes between dates. We used increases of > 0.2 NDVI to represent an improvement in forest quality.    Federal Census data organization: Urban Basic Services and Housing indicator, socioeconomic and population:The data used to infer the values of basic services provision, socioeconomic and population drivers was derived from the Brazilian National Census data (IBGE, 2000 and 2010). Population density, permanent housing unit density, mean income, basic education, and the percentage of houses receiving waste collection, sanitation and water provision services, called basic services in the context of this study, were calculated per 30 m pixel. The Human Development Index is only available at the municipality level. We attributed the HDI for the vector file with the municipality border, and we rasterized (30 m resolution) this file in QGIS. Annual rates of change were then calculated to allow comparability between LULC periods. To infer the BSH, we used only areas with an increase in permanent housing density and basic services provision (See Supplementary Material I at the original publication).    Topographic driversTo infer the values of the topographic driver, we used the slope data and the Topographic Index Position (TPI) based on the digital elevation model from SRTM (30 m resolution) produced by ALOS (freely available at eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/about/about_index.htm), and both variables were considered constant from 2005 to 2015 (See Supplementary Material I at the original publication).";"Hersperger, Anna M; Pierri Daunt, Ana Beatriz";https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/spatial-planning-brazil;2022-01-06T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/spatial-planning-brazil;envidat;Spatially explicit data to evaluate spatial planning outcomes in a coastal region in São Paulo State, Brazil;03206CF3-5A64-4D8F-A7F2-73FF7AEB1111;157789

In this study, the Austin metropolitan area, Texas, U.S., one of the fastest urban transformations and transformations regions, is selected to test the hypothesis that spatial planning and policies are important factors of urban transformations. Despite ample previous work in understanding the interactions between human and urban form transformation at specific areas, the actual interventions and outcomes of planning and policies (e.g., ‘smart growth’) on urban forms have been poorly measured. In this study, the potential influencing factors of urban transformations of Austin over 25 years were selected and collected.;Zhao, Chunhong;10.16904/envidat.284;2022-02-07T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/potential-driving-factors-of-urban-transformations-of-austin-over-25-years;envidat;Potential driving factors of urban transformations of Austin over 25 years;F5D7F694-5151-40AA-B811-7CFA53707F8C;157789
The present dataset is part of the report titled Gradinaru S.R., Hersperger A.M., Schmid F. (2021). Deriving Planning Intentions from written planning documents. Report on CONCUR Project- From plans to land change: how strategic spatial planning contributes to the development of urban regions. The data corresponds to the data collected as part of the DPI Method for deriving all PIs contained in a plan (open coding) as detailed in section 4 of the report. The method involved reading the plans to break down of information in meaningful discrete “incidents” or planning intentions. To identify the planning intentions, the starting points were represented by a) the structuring of the plans in chapters and sub chapters and b) the themes that the plans addressed. Thus, the collected information was not grouped according to pre-defined categories of planning intentions, but rather put together as a list of intentions as revealed by each plan. As a result, we provide, for each case study, a document (named [Urban region name] PI as defined in the plan) which contains:  Date when the information was filled in.  Name of the urban region and analysed strategic spatial plan .  A list of all planning intentions contained in a plan, with each PI being addresses as follows:  Name of PI as it appears in the plan  Translated name of the PI (i.e. short name for easy understanding of the meaning)  Explanation regarding the meaning of the PI  Why the PI is considered a priority for the urban region  Spatial information on the PI (text and cartographic representations). In total, 14 documents are available, one for each case study. Documents contain up to 20 pages of information extracted from the plans together with explanations and notes taken during plan reading.;"Gradinaru, Simona R; Hersperger, Anna M";10.16904/envidat.275;2022-01-18T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/planning-intentions-in-strategic-plans-of-european-urban-regions;envidat;" Planning intentions in strategic plans of European urban regions";82C8CCA7-3A0F-440A-BCE0-674F1D2A1224;157789

Specifically, the paper has the following workflow: (i) to develop a framework for consistency assessment covering four categories of external consistency; (ii) to extract relevant plan statements from all plans on the four categories; (iii) to assign one-way, symmetrical and contradictory relationships between the extracted plan statements; and (iv) to assess consistencies, inconsistencies and contradictions between plans using directed and valued network analyses. All results were then validated by applying questionnaires to local experts. The study focuses on a sample consisting of 10 spatial plans of Bucharest that: (1) are currently in force, (2) have spatial implications, (3) involve different administrative levels and (4) come from different planning sectors. The list of the reviewed planning documents can be found in Table 2 of the paper. The framework of consistency assessment contains 24 items, which can be found in Table 1 of the paper.

"Book of abstracts from the virtual conference ""From Plans to Land Change: Dynamics of Urban Regions""Cities and urban regions are among the most dynamic land-use systems in the world, with dramatic consequences for the provision of ecosystem services and the livelihood of people. Planning is a multifaceted activity with extensive experience in the management of these urbanization processes. However, our understanding of planning’s contribution to shaping urban land use, form and structure is still incomplete, with serious consequences for the efficacy of urban planning and land change models.This international conference aims to bring together the community of scholars working on planning evaluation and urban modelling. The participants are offered the opportunity to present their current research and to discuss how theoretical developments, data sources, comparative studies and modelling approaches might advance the field.The conference was financially supported by the CONCUR project and sustained by Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.";Hersperger, Anna M;10.16904/envidat.217;2021-04-07T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/book-of-abstracts-from-plans-to-land-change-dynamics-of-urban-regions;envidat;" From Plans to Land Change: Dynamics of Urban Regions.

The data set lsUDPs: 3.1 Selection of cases and data collection; 3.2 Data management and operationalisation    General context of the data set ""lsUDPs"" The data set ""lsUDPs"" has been generated as part of the CONCUR research project (https://www.wsl.ch/en/projects/concur.html) led by Dr. Anna M. Hersperger and funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (ERC TBS Consolidator Grant (ID: BSCGIO 157789) for the period 2016-2020. The CONCUR research project is interdisciplinary and aims to develop a scientific basis for adequately integrating spatial policies (in this case, strategic spatial plans) into quantitative land-change modelling approaches at the urban regional level. The first stage (2016-2017) of the CONCUR project focussed on 21 urban regions in Western Europe. The urban regions were selected through a multi-stage strategy for empirical research (see Hersperger, A. M., Grădinaru, S., Oliveira, E., Pagliarin, S., & Palka, G. (2019). Understanding strategic spatial planning to effectively guide development of urban regions. Cities, 94, 96-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.05.032 ).    Background and aims of the study using the data set lsUDPs As part of the CONCUR project, a specific task was to examine the relationship between strategic spatial plans and the formulation and implementation (i.e. urban land change) of large-scale urban development projects in Western Europe. Strategic urban projects are typically large-scale, prominent urban transformations implemented locally with the aim to stimulate urban growth, for instance in the form of urban renewals of deprived neighborhoods, waterfront renewals and transport infrastructures. While strategic urban projects are referred to in the literature with multiple terms, in the CONCOR project we call them large-scale urban development projects (lsUDPs). Previous studies acknowledged both local and supra-local (or structural) factors impacting the context-specific implementation of lsUDPs. Local governance factors, such as institutional capacity, coordination among public and private actors and political leadership, intertwine with supra-local conditions, such as state re-scaling processes and devolution of state competencies in spatial planning, de-industrialisation and increasing social inequality. Hence, in implementing lsUDPs, multi-scalar factors act in combination. Because the formulation and implementation of lsUDPs require multi-scalar coordination among coalitions of public and private actors over an extended period of time, they are generally linked to strategic spatial plans (SSPs). Strategic spatial plans convey collective visions and horizons of action negotiated among public and private actors at the local and/or regional level to steer future urban development, and can contain legally binding dispositions, but also indicative guidelines. The key question remains as to what extent large-scale urban development projects and strategic spatial plans can be regarded as aligned. By alignment, or “concordance”, we mean that strategic projects are formulated and implemented as part of the strategic planning process (“high concordance”), or that the strategic role of projects is reconfirmed in (subsequent) strategic plans (“moderate concordance”). Lack of concordance is found when lsUDPs have been limitedly (or not at all) acknowledged in strategic spatial plans. We assume that certain local and supra-local factors, characterising the development of the projects, foster (but not strictly “cause”) the degree of alignment between lsUPDs and SSPs. In this study, we empirically examine how, and to what extent, the concordance between 38 European large-scale urban development projects and strategic plans (outcome: CONCOR) has been enabled by five multi-scalar factors (or conditions): (i) the role of the national state (STATE), (ii) the role of (inter)national private actors (PRIVATE), (iii) the occurrence of supra-regional external events (EVENTS), (iv) the degree of transport connectivity (TRANSP), and (v) local resistance from civil society (RESIST). We adopted a (multi-data) case-based qualitative strategy for empirical research and applied the formalised procedure of within- and cross-case comparison offered by fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis appropriate for the goal of this study. Based on set theory, QCA formally integrates contextual sensitivity to case specificities (within-case knowledge) with systematic comparative analysis (across-case knowledge). The research question the data set has been created to reply to is the following: which conditions, and combinations of conditions, enable the concordance between large-scale urban development projects and strategic spatial plans? The conditions (“independent variables”) considered are. STATE: the set of large-scale urban projects characterized by a high degree of state intervention and support in their formulation and implementation, PRIVATE: the set of large-scale urban projects characterized by a high degree of involvement of (inter)national private actors in their formulation and implementation, EVENTS: the set of large-scale strategic projects whose formulation and implementation have been strongly affected by unforeseen international events and/or global trends, TRANSP: the set of large-scale strategic projects with a high degree of road and/or transit connectivity, and RESIST: set of large-scale strategic projects whose realization has been characterized by resistances that have substantially delayed or modified the project implementation. The outcome (“dependent variable”) under analysis is CONCOR: the set of large-scale urban projects having a high degree of concordance/alignment/integration with strategic spatial plans    The data set lsUDPs    3.1 Selection of cases and data collection To generate the current data set on large-scale urban development projects in European urban regions (data set ""lsUDPs""), we identified 35 large-scale urban development projects in a sample of the 21 Western urban regions considered in the CONCUR project (see supra, Hersperger et al. 2019): Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Lyon, Manchester, Milan, Stockholm, Stuttgart. The criteria we followed to identify the 35 large-scale urban development projects are: geographical location, size (large-scale), site (located either in the city core or in the larger urban region) and urban function (e.g. housing, transportation infrastructures, service and knowledge economic functions). Employing these criteria facilitated the selection of diverse large-scale urban development projects while still ensuring sufficient comparability. In 2016, we performed 47 in-depth interviews with experts in urban and regional planning and large-scale strategic projects and infrastructure (i.e. academics and practitioners) about the formulation, implementation and development (1990s-2010s) of each project in each of the 9 selected urban regions. On average, each interviewee answered questions on 3.1 large-scale urban development projects. Three cases were subdivided into two cases because a clear differentiation between specific implementation stages was identified by the interviewees (expansion of the Barcelona airport, cases “bcn_airport80-90” and “bcn_airport00-16”; realisation of Lyon Part-Dieu, cases “lyo_partdieu70-90” and “lyo_partdieu00-16”; MediaCityUK, cases “man_salfordquays80-00” and “man_mediacityuk00-16”). Therefore, from the initial 35 cases, the final number of analysed cases in the lsUDPs dataset is 38.    3.2 The data set lsUDPs: Data management and operationalisationInterviews were fully transcribed and analysed through MAXQDA (version 12.3, VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany), and intercoder agreement was evaluated on a sample of nine interviews. We also compiled “synthetic case descriptions” (SCD) for each case (totalling more than 160 SCDs) to spot potential inconsistencies among interviewees’ accounts and to facilitate completion of the “calibration table” for each case (see below). An online expert survey distributed to the interviewees (response rate 78%) helped systematise the information collected during the interviews. We also consulted both academic and gray literature on the case studies to check for possible ambiguity and inconsistencies in the interview data, and to solve discrepancies between our assigned set membership scores and questionnaire values. Site visits were also carried out to retrieve additional information on the selected cases. For each case (i.e. each of the 38 selected large-scale urban development projects), we operationalised each condition (i.e. STATE, PRIVATE, EVENTS, TRANSP, RESIST) and the outcome (CONCOR) in terms of sets, for subsequent application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis. This process is called “calibration”; we used a number of indicators for each condition to qualitatively assess each large-scale project across the conditions. The case-based qualitative assessment was then transformed into fuzzy-set membership values. Fuzzy-set membership values range from 0 to 1, and should be conceived as “fundamentally interpretative tools” that “operationalize theoretical concepts in a way that enhances the dialogue between ideas and evidence” (Ragin 2000:162, in “Fuzzy-set Social Science”. Chicago: University Press). We employed a four-value fuzzy-set scale (0, 0.33, 0.67, 1) to “quantify” into set membership scores the individual histories of cases retrieved from interview data. Only the condition TRANSP was calibrated as a crisp-set (0, 1). The translation of qualitative case-based information into numerical fuzzy-set membership values was iteratively performed by populating a calibration table following standard practices recently emerged in QCA when dealing with qualitative (interview) data.";"Hersperger, Anna M; Pagliarin, Sofia";10.16904/envidat.89;2019-08-22T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/large-scale-urban-development-projects-in-european-urban-regions;envidat;" lsUDPS Large-scale urban development projects in European urban regions ";468094AD-4915-45EA-89E9-9CA8EB43DE27;157789

In brain, signaling mediated by cell adhesion molecules defines the identity and functional properties of synapses. The specificity of presynaptic and postsynaptic interactions that is presumably mediated by cell adhesion molecules suggests that there exists a logic that could explain neuronal connectivity at the molecular level. Despite its importance, however, the nature of such logic is poorly understood, and even basic parameters, such as the number, identity, and single-cell expression profiles of candidate synaptic cell adhesion molecules, are not known. Here, we devised a comprehensive list of genes involved in cell adhesion, and used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze their expression in electrophysiologically defined interneurons and projection neurons. We compared the cell type-specific expression of these genes with that of genes involved in transmembrane ion conductances (i.e., channels), exocytosis, and rho/rac signaling, which regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Using these data, we identified two independent, developmentally regulated networks of interacting genes encoding molecules involved in cell adhesion, exocytosis, and signal transduction. Our approach provides a framework for a presumed cell adhesion and signaling code in neurons, enables correlating electrophysiological with molecular properties of neurons, and suggests avenues toward understanding synaptic specificity.;"Aoto, Jason; Darmanis, Spyros; Földy, Csaba; Malenka, Robert C.; Quake, Stephen R.; Südhof, Thomas C.";GSE75386;2016-08-30T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75386;Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);Single-cell RNAseq reveals cell adhesion molecule profiles in electrophysiologically defined neurons;3F3F8535-0320-4DEE-85EF-3E4114945F85;166815

"CCK-expressing interneurons (CCK+INs) are crucial for controlling hippocampal activity. We found two firing phenotypes of CCK+INs in rat hippocampal CA3 area; either possessing a previously undetected membrane potential-dependent firing or regular firing phenotype, due to different low-voltage-activated potassium currents. These different excitability properties destine the two types for distinct functions, because the former is essentially silenced during realistic 8-15 Hz oscillations. By contrast, the general intrinsic excitability, morphology and gene-profiles of the two types were surprisingly similar. Even the expression of Kv4.3 channels were comparable, despite evidences showing that Kv4.3-mediated currents underlie the distinct firing properties. Instead, the firing phenotypes were correlated with the presence of distinct isoforms of Kv4 auxiliary subunits (KChIP1 vs. KChIP4e and DPP6S). Our results reveal the underlying mechanisms of two previously unknown types of CCK+INs and demonstrate that alternative splicing of few genes, which may be viewed as a minor change in the cells’ whole transcriptome, can determine cell-type identity.";"Arszovszki, Antónia; Földy, Csaba; Lőrincz, Andrea; Lukacsovich, David; Nusser, Zoltan; Oláh, Viktor János; Szabadics, János; Winterer, Jochen";GSE133951;2020-06-03T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133951;NCBI GEO;Functional specification of CCK+ interneurons by alternative isoforms of Kv4.3 auxiliary subunits;239CF85D-E69A-400F-8B97-486FD37D1106;166815
AbstractThe diversity reflected by >100 different neural cell types fundamentally contributes to brain function and a central idea is that neuronal identity can be inferred from genetic information. Recent large-scale transcriptomic assays seem to confirm this hypothesis, but a lack of morphological information has limited the identification of several known cell types. In this study, we used single-cell RNA-seq in morphologically identified parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs), and studied their transcriptomic states in the morphological, physiological, and developmental domains. Overall, we find high transcriptomic similarity among PV-INs, with few genes showing divergent expression between morphologically different types. Furthermore, PV-INs show a uniform synaptic cell adhesion molecule (CAM) profile, suggesting that CAM expression in mature PV cells does not reflect wiring specificity after development. Together, our results suggest that while PV-INs differ in anatomy and in vivo activity, their continuous transcriptomic and homogenous biophysical landscapes are not predictive of these distinct identities.;"Földy, Csaba; Lukacsovich, David; Luo, Wenshu; Que, Lin";GSE142546;2021-12-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142546;NCBI GEO;Transcriptional and morphological profiling of parvalbumin interneuron subpopulations in the mouse hippocampus;4CB31F00-DA40-4ECA-A785-A383EFC96FA5;166815

"We describe one of the oldest notoungulate skeletons with associated craniodental and postcranial elements: Thomashuxleya externa (Isotemnidae) from Cañadón Vaca in Patagonia, Argentina (Vacan subage of the Casamayoran SALMA, middle Eocene). We provide body mass estimates given by different elements of the skeleton, describe the bone histology, and study its phylogenetic position. We note differences in the scapulae, humerii, ulnae and radii of the new specimen in comparison with other specimens previously referred to this taxon. We estimate a body mass of 84 ± 24.2 kg, showing that notoungulates had acquired a large body mass by the middle Eocene. Bone histology shows that the new specimen was skeletally mature. The new material supports the placement of Thomashuxleya as an early, divergent member of Toxodontia. Among placentals, our phylogenetic analysis of a combined DNA, collagen, and morphology matrix favor only a limited number of possible phylogenetic relationships, but cannot yet arbitrate between potential affinities with Afrotheria or Laurasiatheria. With no constraint, maximum parsimony supports Thomashuxleya and Carodnia with Afrotheria. With Notoungulata and Litopterna constrained as monophyletic (including Macrauchenia and Toxodon known for collagens), these clades are reconstructed on the stem to Euungulata (i.e., Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla). Unconstrained, Bayesian analysis weakly supports the possibility that Thomashuxleya is a stem xenarthran; with Notoungulata and Litopterna constrained as monophyletic, the two clades are recovered as sister to Perissodactyla. Anatomical data sampled thus far for Thomashuxleya, combined with collagen amino acids for Pleistocene meridiungulates, substantially limit the number of possible affinities for endemic South American species among mammals, although ambiguity still remains.";"Asher, Robert J.; Carrillo, Juan D.";10.7934/P2084;2017-07-19T00:00:00Z;http://dx.doi.org/10.7934/P2084;MorphoBank;Project 2084: J.

South America was isolated during most of the Cenozoic, and it was home to an endemic fauna. The South American Native Ungulates (SANUs) exhibited high taxonomical, morphological, and ecological diversity and were widely distributed on the continent. However, most SANU fossil records come from high latitudes. This sampling bias challenges the study of their diversity dynamics and biogeography during important tectonic and biotic events, such as the Great American Biotic Interchange, the faunal exchange between North and South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. We describe new SANU remains from the Neogene of the Cocinetas (northern Colombia) and Falcon (northwestern Venezuela) Basins. In the Cocinetas Basin, the middle Miocene fauna of the Castilletes Formation includes Hilarcotherium miyou sp. nov. (Astrapotheriidae), cf. Huilatherium (Leontiniidae), and Lambdaconus cf. L. colombianus (Proterotheriidae). The late Pliocene fauna of the Ware Formation includes a Toxodontinae indet. and the putative oldest record of Camelidae in South America. In the Falcon Basin, the Pliocene/Pleistocene faunas of the Codore and San Gregorio Formations include Falcontoxodon aguilerai gen. et sp. nov. and Proterotheriidae indet. We provide a phylogenetic analysis for Astrapotheriidae and Toxodontidae. The new data document a low-latitude provinciality within some SANU clades (e.g., Astrapotheriidae, Leontiniidae) during the middle Miocene. This contrasts with the wide latitudinal distribution of clades of other mammals recorded in the fauna, including the sparassodont Lycopsis padillai, the sloth Hyperleptus, and the proterotheriid Lambdaconus cf. L. colombianus.;"Amson, Eli; Carrillo, Juan D.; Cuartas, Carlos; Jaramillo, Carlos; Quiroz, Luis; Rincon, Aldo F.; Sanchez, Rodolfo; Sanchez-Villagra, Marcelo R.";10.5061/dryad.m1n44;;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m1n44;Dryad;Data from: The Neogene record of northern South American native ungulates;7AB2559B-6922-41C7-BFF7-FC4433C9D68D;165068

Deceptive pollination often involves volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions that mislead insects into performing non-rewarding pollination. Among deceptively pollinated plants, Arum maculatum is particularly well-known for its potent dung-like VOC emissions and specialized floral chamber, which traps pollinators - mainly Psychoda phalaenoidesand P. grisescens - overnight. However, little is known about the genes underlying the production of many A. maculatumVOCs, and their influence on variation in pollinator attraction rates. Therefore, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing of A. maculatum appendix and male floret tissue collected during- and post-anthesis, from ten natural populations across Europe. These RNA-seq data were paired with GC-MS analyses of floral scent composition and pollinator data collected from the same inflorescences. Differential expression analyses revealed candidate transcripts in appendix tissue linked to malodourous VOCs including indole, p-cresol, and 2-heptanone. Additionally, we found that terpene synthase expression in male floret tissue during anthesis significantly covaried with sex- and species-specific attraction of Psychoda phalaenoides and P. grisescens. Taken together, our results provide the first insights into molecular mechanisms underlying pollinator attraction patterns in A. maculatum, and highlight floral chamber sesquiterpene (e.g.bicyclogermacrene) synthases as interesting candidate genes for further study.;"Alvarez, Nadir; Gauthier, Jérémy; Gibernau, Marc; Godschalx, Adrienne L; Rasmann, Sergio; Szenteczki, Mark A";10.5281/zenodo.6806366;2022-07-07T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/6806366;Zenodo;Transcriptomic analysis of deceptively pollinated Arum maculatum (Araceae) reveals association between terpene synthase expression in floral trap chamber and species-specific pollinator attraction;1D2778B5-15E0-4984-8AAE-B326598A24BD;191659

The human leukemia cell line (HL-60) is an alternative to primary neutrophils in research studies. However, because HL-60 cells proliferate in an incompletely differentiated state, they must undergo differentiation before they acquire the functional properties of neutrophils. Here we provide evidence of swarming and chemotaxis in differentiated HL-60 neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) using precise microfluidic assays. We found that dimethyl sulfoxide differentiated HL-60 cells (DdHL-60) have a larger size, increased length, and lower ability to squeeze through narrow channels compared to primary neutrophils. They migrate through tapered microfluidic channels slower than primary neutrophils, but faster than HL-60s differentiated by other protocols, e.g., using all-trans retinoic acid. We found that dHL-60 can swarm toward zymosan particle clusters, though they display disorganized migratory patterns and produce swarms of smaller size compared to primary neutrophils.;"Babatunde, Kehinde Adebayo; Hopke, Alex; Irimia, Daniel; Lannes, Nils; Mantel, Pierre-Yves; Wang, Xiao";10.6084/m9.figshare.14445363;2021-12-12T00:00:00Z;https://figshare.com/s/732fd7c0061c3608ce43;Figshare;Chemotaxis and swarming in differentiated HL-60 neutrophil-like cells;9F3E89FE-1414-4899-AC99-EB85FC5742F8;181378

Observer: Jakob WinterSampling period: January - August 2021Sample: 27 British layer flocks (70 video observed locations). The flocks originated from two major British Egg producer organisations.To investigate the behavioural mechanisms of piling behaviour on British layer flocks, I first assessed the flock behaviour of 27 layer flocks and recording 70 individual video recording locations. The following data set contains the results of the video assessments. In total, I spotted and characterised 92 piling events. The characterisation of piles includes piling specifics such as the start time, end time, duration, trigger, and the number of involved animals. Furthermore, I provide relevant information (including breed, population age, production system) about the flocks where I spotted piling behaviour (20 flocks). Finally, I provide relevant information about environmental factors associated with piling behaviour, including the lighting schedule, flock size, colony size and production form. This data set is unique as it is the first describing piling behaviour across multiple British layer flocks. Furthermore, it provides a good ground for testing relations between flock characteristics and environmental factors of the birds and piling behaviour. I will publish this data set after publishing my findings in an international journal.;"Nicol, Christine; Winter, Jakob";*updated after publication;;https://www.re3data.org;www.re3data.org;Piling characteristics on British layer flocks;00CE1414-08BD-44C4-96AF-77DFFBC6548E;191797
The Spoken CALL Shared Task is an initiative to create an open challenge dataset for speech-enabled CALL systems, jointly organised by the University of Geneva, the University of Birmingham, Radboud University and the University of Cambridge. The task is based on data collected from a speech-enabled online tool which has been used to help young Swiss German teens practise skills in English conversation. Items are prompt-response pairs, where the prompt is a piece of German text and the response is a recorded English audio file. The task is to label pairs as “accept” or “reject”, accepting responses which are grammatically and linguistically correct to match a set of hidden gold standard answers as closely as possible. Resources are provided so that a scratch system can be constructed with a minimal investment of effort, and in particular without necessarily using a speech recogniser.The first edition of the task was announced at LREC 2016, with training data released in July 2016 and test data in March 2017, and attracted 20 entries from 9 groups. Results, including seven papers, were presented at the SLaTE workshop in August 2017. Full details, including links to resources, results and papers, can be found on the Shared Task home page.Following the success of the original task, we are organising a second edition. We will approximately double the amount of training data, provide new test data, and release improved versions of the accompanying resources. In particular, we will make generally available the open source Kaldi recogniser developed by the University of Birmingham, which achieved the best performance on the original task, together with versions of the training and test data pre-processed through this recogniser. Results will be presented in a special session at Interspeech 2018.;"Baur, Claudia; Caines, Andrew; Chua, Cathy; Gerlach, Johanna; Rayner, Manny";Spoken CALL Shared Task, second edition;2018-02-07T00:00:00Z;https://regulus.unige.ch/spokencallsharedtask_2ndedition/;Geneva University website;Spoken CALL Shared Task, second edition;923B1949-1A5B-4869-A48F-7FE65582FBF5;177065

"A popular idea in CALL is to use multimodal annotated texts, with annotations typically including embedded audio and translations, to support L2 learning through reading. An important question is how to create the audio, which can be done either through human recording or by a TTS engine. We may reasonably expect TTS to be quicker and easier, but human to be of higher quality. Here, we report a study using the open source LARA platform and ten languages. Samples of LARA audio totalling about 3.5 minutes were provided for each language in both human and TTS form; subjects used a web form to compare different versions of the same item and rate the voices as a whole.

"This data set contains salinity measurements from discrete seawater samples that were collected in the Southern Ocean (south of 30deg S) during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). 657 samples were collected during the period December 24th, 2016 and March 18th, 2017 in the Southern Ocean from the surface ocean using the ship's underway line (UW; 328 samples) and in vertical profiles using Niskin bottles mounted on the CTD rosette (273 samples). A few additional samples (56) were collected from a parallel cast with a trace-metal rosette, with a bucket, and as duplicates to ensure data quality. All samples were analyzed for their salinity and results are reported on the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78; Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., 1989). Measurements were performed on a Guildline Autosal Laboratory Salinometer 8400(B) at CSIRO (Hobart, Australia) for samples collected during leg 1, and on a OPTIMARE Precision Salinometer (OPS) at the Alfred Wegener Institute (Bremerhaven, Germany) for samples collected during legs 2 and 3.

"This data set contains vertical seawater temperature profiles measured by Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) probes that were deployed in the Southern Ocean during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) on board the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov. 40 XBT probes were deployed during legs 2 and 3 of the expedition in the period 25th January, 2017 to 17th March, 2017. The XBT probes are manufactured and distributed by T.S.K./Sippican Tsurumi-Seiki Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan (http://www.tsk-jp.com) and are of the type T-07, which is rated at a ship speed of up to 15 knots. These probes have a measuring time of 123 seconds and maximum measurement depth of about 789 m. Probes were launched from a handheld device from the stern of the ship either on the port or starboard side while the ship was moving. The deck unit recorded the temperature and the time since the probe was launched. This time was then converted to depth using the known fall rate of the probe in seawater and the coefficients provided by the manufacturer (WMO standards; Hanawa et al., 1995). The profiles were corrected for known surface biases (Kizu and Hanawa, 2002; Uehara et al., 2008). We provide the raw data, the data produced by using the coefficients provided by the manufacturer, and a corrected version in which we apply an empirical correction based on a comparison with CTD data (Henry et al., 2019), where XBT profiles were launched alongside the CTD deployment. The data has been quality controlled by comparing it to a number of CTD profiles. Data is provided at full vertical resolution and a 1-m averaged resolution. In addition, we provide derived variables such as surface mixed layer depth (temperature threshold) estimates. We are grateful to the crew of the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov and AARI for donating these probes to our project. Their use-by date had expired, however this was not seen as an issue.

Brown adipose tissue has been extensively studied in the last decade for its potential to counteract the obesity pandemic. However, the paracrine regulation within brown tissue is largely unknown. Here, we show that local acetate directly inhibits brown fat thermogenesis, without changing acetate levels in the circulation. We demonstrate that modulating acetate within brown tissue at physiological levels blunts its function and systemically decreases energy expenditure. Using a series of transcriptomic analyses, we identified genes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and brown adipocyte formation, which are down-regulated upon local acetate administration. Overall, these findings demonstrate that local acetate inhibits brown fat function.;"Dong, Hua; Sun, Wenfei; Wolfrum, Christian";10.1073/pnas.2116125118;2021-11-19T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-10680;ARRAYEXPRESS;Local acetate inhibits brown adipose tissue function;445B9572-0615-4E63-A43F-578AC3F75DD1;191874
Abstract Healthy adipose tissue remodeling depends on the balance between de novo adipogenesis from adipogenic progenitor cells and the hypertrophy of adipocytes. De novo adipogenesis has been shown to promote healthy adipose tissue expansion, which confers protection from obesity-associated insulin resistance. Here, we define the role and trajectory of different adipogenic precursor subpopulations and further delineate the mechanism and cellular trajectory of adipogenesis, using single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of murine adipogenic precursors. We identify Rspo2 as a functional regulator of adipogenesis, which is secreted by a subset of CD142 + cells to inhibit maturation of early progenitors through the receptor Lgr4. Increased circulating RSPO2 in mice leads to adipose tissue hypertrophy and insulin resistance and increased RSPO2 levels in male obese individuals correlate with impaired glucose homeostasis. Taken together, these findings identify a complex cellular crosstalk that inhibits adipogenesis and impairs adipose tissue homeostasis.;"Baláz, Miroslav; Balázová, Lucia; Blüher, Matthias; Ding, Lianggong; Dong, Hua; Hamilton, Bradford; Klein, Holger; Klöting, Nora; Löffler, Mona; Neubauer, Heike; Shen, Yang; Sun, Wenfei; Wolfrum, Christian";10.1038/s42255-021-00509-1;2022-01-13T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-11104;ARRAYEXPRESS;Identification of a regulatory pathway inhibiting adipogenesis via RSPO2;18CC260D-35F1-4855-AEC3-4D303FE6861F;191874

Abstract The bacterial division apparatus catalyses the synthesis and remodelling of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) to build the cell wall layer that fortifies the daughter cell poles. Understanding of this essential process has been limited by the lack of native three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli . We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the septal architecture and mode of division can be modified to more closely resemble that of other Gram-negative ( Caulobacter crescentus ) or Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria, suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the formation of different septal morphologies. Finally, analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation (Δ envC Δ nlpD ) showed that cell wall remodelling affects the placement and stability of the cytokinetic ring.

"Compilation of data used to support the article: ""Co-location of the downdip end of seismic coupling and the continental shelf break"" preprint DOI: 10.31223/osf.io/uwzbrAlong subduction margins, the morphology of the near shore domain records the combined action of erosion from ocean waves and permanent tectonic deformation from the convergence of plates. We observe that at subduction margins around the globe, the edge of continental shelves tends to be located above the downdip end of seismic coupling on the megathrust. Coastlines lie farther landward at variable distances. This observation stems from a compilation of well-resolved coseismic and interseismic coupling datasets. The permanent interseismic uplift component of the total tectonic deformation can explain the localization of the shelf break. It contributes a short wave-length gradient in vertical deformation on top of the structural and isostatic deformation of the margin. This places a hinge line between seaward subsidence and landward uplift above the downdip end of high coupling. Landward of the hinge line, rocks are uplifted in the domain of wave-base erosion and a shelf is maintained by the competition of rock uplift and wave erosion. wave erosion then sets the coastline back from the tectonically meaningful shelf break.We combine a wave erosion model with an elastic deformation model to illustrate how the downdip end of high coupling pins the location of the shelf break. In areas where the shelf is wide, onshore geodetic constraints on seismic coupling is limited and could be advantageously complemented by considering the location of the shelf break. Subduction margin morphology integrates hundreds of seismic cycles and could inform seismic coupling stability through time.";Malatesta, Luca;doi: 10.5880/GFZ.4.7.2020.002;2020-12-22T00:00:00Z;https://dataservices.gfz-potsdam.de/panmetaworks/review/76cc34fa37275fae183f94743316315b64049915d4c393f44106b203f7cb9e20/;GFZ DataServices;Compiled locations of subduction deformation front, downdip end of high coupling, shelf break, and coastline. v. 1.;15CAE417-5A78-4A6B-956E-73EF4361A06F;168328

While experiencing the unpredictable events of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are likely to turn to people in order to regulate our emotions. In this research, we investigate how this interpersonal emotion regulation is connected to affective symptoms, above and beyond intrapersonal emotion regulation. Furthermore, we explore whether perceived psychosocial resources moderate these associations, i.e., if individuals reporting healthier social connections benefit differently from interpersonal emotion regulation. N = 1401 participants from the USA, UK, Germany, and Switzerland completed an online survey that included text samples. Affective symptoms (depression, adjustment disorder, fear of COVID-19) were examined based on self-reported as well as language-based indicators. As psychosocial resources, we examined social support, loneliness, attachment style, and trust. We defined latent variables for adaptive and maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation and analyzed how they were associated with affective symptoms controlling for intrapersonal emotion regulation. Further, we analyzed how they interacted with psychosocial resources. Maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies were associated with affective symptoms. With lower psychosocial resources, the associations between interpersonal emotion regulation and depressive symptoms were more pronounced. The results highlight that maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation is associated with worse mental health. These effects are not buffered by more psychosocial resources and are stronger for people with low psychosocial resources.;"Boyd, Ryan L.; Dworakowski, Olenka; Horn, Andrea B.; Huber, Zilla M.; Martin, Mike; Meier, Tabea";https://osf.io/rgvbz;2022-12-25T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/rgvbz/?view_only=3b0cdeb3af2646a0bcd139ff31feda4f;Open Science Framework;You Do Not Have to Get through This Alone: Interpersonal Emotion Regulation and Psychosocial Resources during the COVID-19 Pandemic across Four Countries;B0FB13E6-22E3-4016-87D2-7C5ECEEE70A1;199409

In an immersion incident, a person may be required to tread water for extended periods of time in order to survive. Treading water, or maintaining a stable head position above the water surface, can be achieved in several different ways.Determining which treading water techniques are economic (energetically and cognitively) is an important step in providing evidence-based water safety instruction.Previous work in skilled water treaders showed that both 'upright breaststroke' and 'egg-beater' are economic for well-trained water treaders, however, this has not been investigated in less skilled treaders.The present study extends the existing data in experts by assessing inexperienced swimmers and experienced swimmers with no formal water treading experience / training.

Ecological intensification may reduce environmental externalities of agriculture by harnessing biodiversity to benefit regulating ecosystem services. However, to propose management options for the production of such services, there is a need to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of net effects between ecosystem services and disservices provided by wild organisms across taxonomic groups in relation to habitat and landscape management. We studied the contribution of predatory vertebrates and invertebrates (including both carnivores and seed herbivores) to regulating ecosystem services and disservices in 16 cereal fields in response to a local habitat contrast and a landscape complexity gradient. From May to November 2016 we provided weed (predation reflects an ecosystem service) and crop (predation reflects a disservice) seeds, as well as pest (predation reflects an ecosystem service) and beneficial (predation reflects a disservice) invertebrate prey to predators. Seed predation was dominated by vertebrates, while vertebrates and invertebrates contributed equally to predation of animal prey. Before harvest, predation steadily increased from very low levels in May to high levels in July independent of the resource type. After harvest, ecosystem services declined more rapidly than disservices. The presence of adjacent semi-natural grasslands promoted crop seed predation, but reduced pest prey predation. Predation on beneficial prey decreased with increasing proportions of semi-natural grassland in the landscape. Predatory vertebrates and invertebrates provide important ecosystem services due to the consumption of pests. However, beneficial invertebrates and crop seeds were often consumed to a similar or even higher extent than harmful invertebrates or weed seeds. Our results therefore raise concerns that management options aimed at enhancing service providers may simultaneously increase levels of disservices. By considering positive and negative effects simultaneously, this study addresses an important knowledge gap and highlights the importance of interactions between local management, landscape composition and service and disservice provision across taxa and over time. Considering trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices when evaluating the net effects of biodiversity conservation measures on ecosystem service provision is crucial. Future agri-environment schemes that offer payments for semi-natural habitats may need to provide higher compensation for farmers in cases where net effects are likely to be negative.;Tschumi, Matthias;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h22c122;2018-08-24T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.h22c122;Dryad;Data from: Predation-mediated ecosystem services and disservices in agricultural landscapes;5943049C-9BC1-4263-9CB7-7FB316FF2A5E;161697

Given the unknown ground truth (underlying cortical sources) of EEG signals, it is critical to evaluate EEG analysis methods using simulations before applying them to real EEG data. EEGSourceSim provides a highly realistic simulation environment for evaluating a wide range of EEG analysis methods. It provides a powerful assessment tool by taking individual variation into account through the use of individual forward models, ROIs based on cortical anatomy and function, and realistic models of signal and noise.;Barzegaran, Elham;DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/FMUAE;2019-04-04T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/fmuae/;EEGSourceSim: A framework for realistic simulation of EEG scalp data using MRI-based forward models and biologically plausible signals and noise;EEGSourceSim: A framework for realistic simulation of EEG scalp data using MRI-based forward models and biologically plausible signals and noise;81F9A5BD-BA95-4B3C-9750-05C7AFC70D7B;174728

Ice mass balance (IMB) buoy data PS81/517 from Weddell Sea, Antarctica, 2013. The buoy was deployed together with an automatic weather station buoy (see under related) on sea ice station PS81/517 from Research Vessel Polarstern in the Antarctic Weddell Sea in austral winter 2013 (cruise leg ANT-XXIX/6, AWECS campaign). The IMB buoy provides data between 2013-07-31T17:28:00 and 2013-10-11T00:30:00.The IMB buoy was kindly provided by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS). The IMB buoy consisted of a thermistor string of 5 m length, with a 2 cm sensor spacing. Interfaces were determined by hand. Heating cycle data was of poor quality, so the interfaces were picked mostly based on temperature. The ice interface will be pretty good (~2 cm accuracy), and the snow is probably a bit more inaccurate. The bottom interface was determined from the existence of a knee in the temperature profile where apparent. The top interface was picked based on the transition to constant temperature in the air and the diurnal variability. This may be subject to some bias, but note that the changes are only a few cm until the end where the IMB probably died because it got washed over (based on recorded temperatures). No flooding is apparent in the measurements.;"Leonard, Katherine; Maksym, Ted; Wever, Nander; White, Seth";10.1594/PANGAEA.933424;2021-08-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.933424;Pangaea.de;Ice mass balance data PS81/517 from Weddell Sea, Antarctica, 2013.;0EF70BF8-8D5B-4534-9CEF-E53D7895FF86;172299

The SMP surveyed the uppermost approximately 25-30 cm of the snow surface, and processed output is available at 2.5 mm vertical resolution. The data contains snow density and grain size. Measurements were performed between 2013-07-31 and 2013-08-04. SMP measurements were done in close proximity (approximately 1-2 m distance) of snow pit locations (see Paul et al., 2017), to enable calibration of the instrument. Two perpendicular transects were made in a field that was surveyed using terrestrial laser scanning, to sample the spatial variability of the snow microstructure on sea ice.

Healthcare providers often underestimate patients’ pain, sometimes even when aware of their reports. This could be the effect of experience reducing sensitivity to others pain, or distrust towards patients’ self-evaluations. Across multiple experiments (375 participants), we tested whether senior medical students differed from younger colleagues and lay controls in the way they assess people’s pain and take into consideration their feedback. We found that medical training affected the sensitivity to pain faces, an effect shown by the lower ratings and highlighted by a decrease in neural response of the insula and cingulate cortex. Instead, distrust towards the expressions’ authenticity affected the processing of feedbacks, by decreasing activity in the ventral striatum whenever patients’ self-reports matched participants’ evaluations, and by promoting strong reliance on the opinion of other doctors. Overall, our study underscores the multiple processes which might influence the evaluation of others’ pain at the early stages of medical career. preprint available at: https://psyarxiv.com/uz9rd/;"Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado; Dirupo, Giada";https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:9006.;2021-04-27T00:00:00Z;https://neurovault.org/collections/9006/;NeuroVault;Brain networks for pain diagnosis.

Abiotic stress is a major force of selection that organisms are constantly facing. While the evolutionary effects of various stressors have been broadly studied, it is only more recently that the relevance of interactions between evolution and underlying ecological conditions, that is, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, have been highlighted. Here, we experimentally investigated how populations adapt to pH-stress under high population densities. Using the protist species Tetrahymena thermophila, we studied how four different genotypes evolved in response to stressfully low pH conditions and high population densities. We found that genotypes underwent evolutionary changes, some shifting up and others shifting down their intrinsic rates of increase (r0). Overall, evolution at low pH led to the convergence of r0 and intraspecific competitive ability (α) across the four genotypes. Given the strongcorrelation between r0 and α, we argue that this convergence was a consequence of selection for increased density-dependent fitness at low pH under the experienced high density conditions. Increased density-dependent fitness was either attained throughincrease in r0, or decrease of α, depending on the genetic background. In conclusion, we show that demography can influence the direction of evolution under abiotic stress.;"Altermatt, Florian; Arquint, Angelina; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Merkli, Stefanie; Moerman, Felix; Wagner, Andreas";0000-0002-5164-0978;2019-12-10T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.mpg4f4qvg;Dryad;Evolution under pH stress and high population densities leads to increased density‐dependent fitness in the protist Tetrahymena thermophila;F8EA5820-51F2-425B-B04A-3ADB1D553A79;179089
"Ecosystems are linked to neighbouring ecosystems not only by dispersal, but also by the movement of subsidy. Such subsidy couplings between ecosystems have important landscape-scale implications because perturbations in one ecosystem may affect community structure and functioning in neighbouring ecosystems via increased/decreased subsidies. Here, we combine a general theoretical approach based on harvesting theory and a two-patch protist meta-ecosystem experiment to test the effect of regional perturbations on local community dynamics. We first characterized the relationship between the perturbation regime and local population demography on detritus production using a mathematical model. We then experimentally simulated a perturbation gradient affecting connected ecosystems simultaneously, thus altering cross-ecosystem subsidy exchanges. We demonstrate that the perturbation regime can interact with local population dynamics to trigger unexpected temporal variations in subsidy pulses from one ecosystem to another. High perturbation intensity initially led to the highest level of subsidy flows; however, the level of perturbation interacted with population dynamics to generate a crash in subsidy exchange over time. Both theoretical and experimental results show that a perturbation regime interacting with local community dynamics can induce a collapse in population levels for recipient ecosystems. These results call for integrative management of human-altered landscapes that takes into account regional dynamics of both species and resource flows.";"Altermatt, Florian; Ganesanandamoorthy, Pravin; Gounand, Isabelle; Harvey, Eric";10.5061/dryad.hm041;2016-08-24T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.hm041;Dryad;Spatially cascading effect of perturbations in experimental meta-ecosystems;A478B4E6-E336-4B7D-A2DF-434FC5BC71F5;179089
1. Movement and dispersal are critical processes for almost all organisms in natural populations. Understanding their causes and consequences is therefore of high interest. While both theoretical and empirical work suggests that dispersal, more exactly emigration, is plastic and may be a function of local population density, the functional relationship between the underlying movement strategies and population density has received less attention. 2. We here present evidence for the shape of this reaction norm and are able to differentiate between three possible cues: the relative number of individuals, the presence of metabolites (chemical cues) and resource availability. 3. We performed microcosm experiments with the ciliate model organism Tet-rahymena in order to understand the plasticity of movement strategies with respect to local density while controlling for possible confounding effects mediated by the availability of different cues. In addition, we investigated how an Allee effect can influence movement and dispersal plasticity. 4. Our findings suggest that movement strategies in Tetrahymena are plastic and density-dependent. The observed movement reaction norm was ushaped. This may be due to an Allee effect which led to negative densitydependence at low population densities and generally positive density-dependence at high population densities due to local competition. This possibly adaptive density-dependent movement strategy was likely mediated by chemical cues. 5. Our experimental work in highly controlled conditions indicates that both environmental cues as well as inherent population dynamics must be considered to understand movement and dispersal.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Kropf, Tabea";10.5061/dryad.383q4;2015-10-31T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.383q4;Dryad;Density-dependent movement and the consequences of the Allee effect in the model organism Tetrahymena;37D857E8-CD88-44C4-A5EB-44A69FDA2041;179089
1. Competition can be fully hierarchical or intransitive, and this degree of hierarchy is driven by multiple factors, including environmental conditions, the functional traits of the species involved or the topology of competition networks. Studies simultaneously analyzing these drivers of competition hierarchy are rare. Additionally, organisms compete either directly or via interference competition for resources or space, within a local neighbourhood or across the habitat. Therefore, the drivers of competition could change accordingly and depend on the taxa studied. 2. We performed the first multi-taxon study on pairwise competition across major taxonomic groups, including experiments with vascular plants, mosses, saprobic fungi, aquatic protists and soil bacteria. We evaluated how general is competition intransitivity from the pairwise competition matrix including all species and also for each possible three-species combination (triplets). We then examined which species were likely to engage in competitive loops and the effects of environmental conditions, competitive rank, and functional traits on intransitive competition. 3. We found some degree of competition intransitivity in all taxa studied, with 38% to 5% of triplets being intransitive. Variance in competitive rank between species and more fertile conditions strongly reduced intransitivity, with triplets composed of species differing widely in their competitive ranks much less likely to be intransitive. 4. Including functional traits of the species involved more than doubled the variation explained compared to models including competitive rank only. Both trait means and variance within triplets affected the odds of them being intransitive. However the traits responsible and the direction of trait effects varied widely between taxa, suggesting that traits can have a wide variety of effects on competition. 5. Synthesis: We evaluated the drivers of competition across multiple taxa and showed that productivity and competitive rank are fundamental drivers of intransitivity. We also showed that not only the functional traits of each species, but also those of the accompanying species, determine competition intransitivity. Intransitive competition is common across multiple taxa but can dampen under fertile conditions or for those species with large variance in their competitive abilities. This provides a first step towards predicting the prevalence of intransitive competition in natural communities.;"Allan, Eric; Altermatt, Florian; Boch, Steffen; Carrara, Francesco; Crowther, Thomas W.; Delgado-Baquerizo, Manuel; Kempel, Anne; Lehmann, Anika; Maynard, Daniel S.; Rillig, Matthias C.; Singh, Brajesh K.; Soliveres, Santiago; Trivedi, Pankaj";10.5061/dryad.bh41r;2019-01-17T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.bh41r;Dryad;Intransitive competition is common across five major taxonomic groups and is driven by productivity, competitive rank and functional traits;88E2A6BC-B5DE-4CC6-9F7B-404AFD5CB16E;179089

In the last two years, governments of many countries imposed heavy social restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, with consequent increase of bad mood, distress, or depression for the people involved. Few studies investigated the impact of these restrictive measures on individual social proficiency, and specifically the processing of emotional facial information, leading to mixed results. The present research aimed at investigating systematically whether, and to which extent, social isolation influences the processing of facial expressions. To this end, we manipulated the social exclusion experimentally through the well-known Cyberball game (within-subject factor), and we exploited the occurrence of the lockdown for the Swiss COVID-19 first wave by recruiting participants before and after being restricted at home (grouping factor). We then tested whether either form of social segregation influenced the processing of pain, disgust or neutral expressions, across multiple tasks probing access to different components of affective facial responses (state-specific, shared across states). We found that the lockdown (but not game-induced exclusion) affected negatively the processing of pain-specific information, without influencing other components of the affective facial response related to disgust or broad unpleasantness. In addition, participants recruited after the confinement reported lower scores in both empathy questionnaires and affective assessments of Cyberball co-players. These results suggest that social isolation affected negatively individual sensitivity to other people’s affect and, with specific reference to the processing of facial expressions, the processing of pain-diagnostic information.;"Antico, Lia; Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado";DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/FNJD8;2022-04-22T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/fnjd8/;Open Science Framework;Far from the eyes, far from the heart.

DNA methylation is a prevalent epigenetic modification involved in transcriptional regulation and essential for mammalian development. While the genome-wide distribution of this mark has been studied to great detail, the mechanisms responsible for its correct deposition, as well as the cause for its aberrant localization in cancers, have not been fully elucidated. Here we have compared the activity of individual DNMT3A isoforms in mouse embryonic stem and neuronal progenitor cells and report that these isoforms differ in their genomic binding and DNA methylation activity at regulatory sites. We identify that the longer isoform DNMT3A1 preferentially localizes to the methylated shores of bivalent CpG island promoters in a tissue-specific manner. The isoform-specific targeting of DNMT3A1 coincides with elevated hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) deposition, suggesting an involvement of this isoform in mediating turnover of DNA methylation at these sites. Through genetic deletion and rescue experiments, we demonstrate that this isoform-specific recruitment plays a role in maintenance of DNA methylation at CpG island shores, with implications on H3K27me3 deposition and regulation of developmental genes.;"Ambrosi, Christina; Baubec, Tuncay; Manzo, Massimiliano; Roschitzki, Bernd; Villaseñor, Rodrigo; Wirz, Joël";GSE96529;2017-10-27T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE96529;Gene Expression Omnibus;Isoform‐specific localization of DNMT3A regulates DNA methylation fidelity at bivalent CpG islands;09D46F28-C3DD-4037-BF4D-35EA1AB09C13;157488
Species that successfully colonized subterranean environments are subject to two opposing selection processes. Stringent abiotic factors select for convergent adaptations, such as loss of eyes and pigments, while interspecific competition drives between-species divergence. Subterranean species can resolve opposing selection by adaptation to physically different microhabitats. Yet, species frequently co-occur in physically homogeneous subterranean habitats, like interstitial. These co-occurrences in such a narrow ecological context can be explained either by equalizing mechanisms, in which neither of the co-occurring species has a competitive advantage, or by more complex niche models that include species’ differentiation along a trophic niche axis. We tested these hypotheses using the amphipod genus Niphargus. We analysed Europe-wide co-occurrence records of Niphargus species from interstitial habitats, split into six independent large-scale regions. Firstly, we addressed whether species’ pairwise co-occurrences are random using a probabilistic model. Secondly, we tested whether species cluster into distinct functional-morphological groups and whether ecologically or phylogenetically distinct species are more likely to co-occur. We found that 68 % of species co-occurrences were not different from random expectation, indicating that most species had access to most sites within each region. The remaining 32 % co-occurred either significantly more or less often than expected by chance. Cluster analysis of functional morphological characters showed that interstitial species belong to two feeding types, micro- and macrofeeders, likely representing two peaks of the interstitial adaptive landscape, and hinting that niche divergence, as a mechanism allowing coexistence, is favoured. Finally, we found that the number of co-occurrences increases with increasing differentiation of functional morphology, but not phylogenetic differences. We conclude that ecological differentiation may be important in shaping such interstitial communities.;"Altermatt, Florian; Delić, Teo; Fiser, Cene; Luštrik, Roman; Zagmajster, Maja";10.5061/dryad.kd3g03r;2019-01-23T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.kd3g03r;Dryad;Niches within a niche: ecological differentiation of subterranean amphipods across Europe’s interstitial waters;F634A487-432D-411B-A561-50E7E50BADF3;179089
Leaf litter processing is an essential ecosystem function in freshwater systems, since much of the carbon and nutrients moving through freshwater food webs come from the surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, it is important to understand how the species performing this function differ, especially because many native species are being replaced by non-native species in aquatic ecosystems. We used a field experiment to examine leaf consumption rates of two common shredding macroinvertebrates (the native Gammarus fossarum and the non-native Gammarus roeselii). Leaves from three species, varying in resource quality, were added both in leaf monocultures and as a three-species mixture. Biomass-adjusted daily consumption rates were similar between the two amphipod species, and each consumed nitrogen-rich alder leaves faster than oak or beech leaves. However, because adult G. roeselii are approximately twice the size of G. fossarum, this led to systematic, though nonsignificant, differences in consumption rates at the per-capita or population level. Furthermore, we found nuanced effects of decomposer identity on leaf decomposition in mixtures. Only G. roeselii showeding increased consumption of the preferred resource (alder) in the mixture, while G. fossarum consumed all leaves at the same proportional rates as in monocultures. This is an important distinction, as most measures of macroinvertebrate leaf shredding are made in the laboratory with only a single leaf resource available. Our results, based on a field experiment which could control the presence of dominant macroinvertebrates while still providing natural, biologically realistic context, suggests that even functionally-similar species may subtly shift ecosystem processes.;"Altermatt, Florian; Little, Chelsea J.";10.5061/dryad.v22901d;2019-02-15T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.v22901d;Dryad;Differential resource consumption in leaf litter mixtures by native and non-native amphipods;E9D8B03E-9B25-4F7D-8E13-1132BF3A0553;179089
1. Leaf litter decomposition is a major ecosystem process that can link aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems by flows of nutrients. Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research hypothesizes that the global loss of species leads to impaired decomposition rates and thus to slower recycling of nutrients. Especially in aquatic systems an understanding of diversity effects on litter decomposition is still incomplete. 2. Here we conducted an experiment to test two main factors associated with global species loss that might influence leaf litter decomposition. Firstly, we tested whether mixing different leaf species alters litter decomposition rates compared to decomposition of these species in monoculture. Secondly, we tested the effect of the size structure of a lotic decomposer community on decomposition rates. 3. Overall, leaf litter identity strongly affected decomposition rates, and the observed decomposition rates matched measures of metabolic activity and microbial abundances. While we found some evidence of a positive leaf litter diversity effect on decomposition, this effect was not coherent across all litter combinations and the effect was generally additive and not synergistic. 4. Microbial communities, with a reduced functional and trophic complexity, showed a small but significant overall reduction in decomposition rates compared to communities with the naturally complete functional and trophic complexity, highlighting the importance of a complete microbial community on ecosystem functioning. 5. Our results suggest that top-down diversity effects of the decomposer community on litter decomposition in aquatic systems are of comparable importance as bottom-up diversity effects of primary producers.;"Altermatt, Florian; Gounand, Isabelle; Harvey, Eric; Santschi, Fabienne";10.5061/dryad.83mr1;2018-08-24T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.83mr1;Dryad;Leaf litter diversity and structure of microbial decomposer communities modulate litter decomposition in aquatic systems;E44A3884-C0DD-404E-A6D3-17FEF512A136;179089
Amajor focus of ecology is to understand and predict ecosystemfunction across scales.Many ecosystem functions are measured only at local scales, while their effects occur at a landscape level. Here we investigate how landscape-scale predictions of ecosystem function depend on intraspecific competition, a fine-scale process, by manipulating intraspecific density of shredding macroinvertebrates and examining effects on leaf litter decomposition, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. For two species, we found that per capita leaf processing rates declined with increasing density following power functions with negative exponents, likely due to interference competition. To demonstrate consequences of this nonlinearity, we scaled up estimates of leaf litter processing fromshredder abundance surveys in 10 replicated headwater streams. In accordance with Jensen’s inequality, applying densitydependent consumption rates reduced estimates of catchment-scale leafconsumption by an order of magnitude relative to density-independent rates. Density-dependent consumption estimates aligned closely with metabolic requirements in catchments with large -but not small- shredder populations. Importantly, shredder abundance was not limited by leaf litter availability, and catchment-level leaf litter supply was much higher than estimated consumption. Thus leaf litter processing was notlimited by resource supply. Our work highlights the need for scaling up, which accounts for intraspecific interactions.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Little, Chelsea J.";0000-0002-4831-6958;2020-03-01T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.3124p62;Dryad;Nonlinear Effects of Intraspecific Competition Alter Landscape-Wide Scaling Up of Ecosystem Function;E1D3186A-A514-443E-9C64-2214652BCAE6;179089
Predator-prey interactions heavily influence the dynamics of many ecosystems. An increasing body of evidence suggests that rapid evolution and coevolution can alter these interactions, with important ecological implications, by acting on traits determining fitness, including reproduction, anti-predatory defence and foraging efficiency. However, most studies to date have focused only on evolution in the prey species, and the predator traits in (co)evolving systems remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated changes in predator traits after approximately 600 generations in a predator-prey (ciliate-bacteria) evolutionary experiment. Predators independently evolved on seven different prey species, allowing generalization of the predator's evolutionary response. We used highly resolved automated image analysis to quantify changes in predator life history, morphology and behaviour. Consistent with previous studies, we found that prey evolution impaired growth of the predator, although the effect depended on the prey species. By contrast, predator evolution did not cause a clear increase in predator growth when feeding on ancestral prey. However, predator evolution affected morphology and behaviour, increasing size, speed and directionality of movement, which have all been linked to higher prey search efficiency. These results show that in (co)evolving systems, predator adaptation can occur in traits relevant to foraging efficiency without translating into an increased ability of the predator to grow on the ancestral prey type.;"Altermatt, Florian; Cairns, Johannes; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Hiltunen, Teppo; Moerman, Felix";0000-0002-4831-6958;2020-06-10T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.08kprr4zr;Dryad;Evolution in interacting species alters predator life-history traits, behaviour and morphology in experimental microbial communities;85B40DB2-DBFF-44EB-9BF7-B0BFC7F82A2D;179089

Abstract Sequence rewriting enables low-cost genome synthesis and the design of biological systems with orthogonal genetic codes. The error-free, robust rewriting of nucleotide sequences can be achieved with a complete annotation of gene regulatory elements. Here, we compare transcription in Caulobacter crescentus to transcription from plasmid-borne segments of the synthesized genome of C. ethensis 2.0 . This rewritten derivative contains an extensive amount of supposedly neutral mutations, including 123’562 synonymous codon changes. The transcriptional landscape refines 60 promoter annotations, exposes 18 termination elements and links extensive transcription throughout the synthesized genome to the unintentional introduction of sigma factor binding motifs. We reveal translational regulation for 20 CDS and uncover an essential translational regulatory element for the expression of ribosomal protein RplS. The annotation of gene regulatory elements allowed us to formulate design principles that improve design schemes for synthesized DNA, en route to a bright future of iteration-free programming of biological systems.;"Christen, Beat; Christen, Matthias; Scheidegger, Clio A.; van Kooten, Mariëlle J.

The accurate cleavage of pre-micro(mi)RNAs by Dicer and mi/siRNA guide strand selection are important steps in forming the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The role of Dicer binding partner TRBP in these processes remains poorly understood. Here, we solved the solution structure of the two N-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) of TRBP in complex with a functionally asymmetric siRNA using NMR, EPR, and single-molecule spectroscopy. We find that siRNA recognition by the dsRBDs is not sequence-specific but rather depends on the RNA shape. The two dsRBDs can swap their binding sites, giving rise to two equally populated, pseudo-symmetrical complexes, showing that TRBP is not a primary sensor of siRNA asymmetry. Using our structure to model a Dicer-TRBP-siRNA ternary complex, we show that TRBP's dsRBDs and Dicer's RNase III domains bind a canonical 19 base pair siRNA on opposite sides, supporting a mechanism whereby TRBP influences Dicer-mediated cleavage accuracy by binding the dsRNA region of the pre-miRNA during Dicer cleavage.;Masliah, Gregoire;https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5N8M;2018-02-21T00:00:00Z;https://www.rcsb.org/;RCSB Protein Data Bank;Macromolecular Structure;99DF70F1-5CE3-4036-B5B9-0365A563837A;170976

Topologically protected magnetic skyrmions have raised interest for future spintronics applications. One of the main challenges is the synthesis of room temperature skyrmion-hosting materials that are compatible with thin-film technology. We present an approach to produce strain-free epitaxial thin films of Co10-xZn10-yMnx+y using molecular beam epitaxy. Bulk Co10-xZn10-yMnx+y is known to host skyrmions at room temperature for specific composition ratios. Our substrate consists of graphene on oxidized silicon. The van der Waals interactions of the grown material with graphene avoids covalent bonding and corresponding strain. We show how defects in the graphene foster nucleation resulting into three different kinds of morphologies: islands, columns and merged films. Susceptibility measurements suggest a phase transition close to room temperature. We detect up to three spin waves resonances suggesting relatively low magnetic damping. This growth technique opens a new route for integrating complex alloys and skyrmionic device concepts with silicon electronics.;"Che, Ping; Escobar Steinvall, Simon; Fontcuberta i Morral, Anna; Grundler, Dirk; Hamdi, Mohammad; Kukolova, Anna; Leran, Jean-Baptiste; Mucchietto, Andrea; Paul, Rajrupa";https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4711359;2021-04-26T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/4711359#.YJqXU6HRY2x;Zenodo;van der Waals Epitaxy of Co10-xZn10-yMnx+y Thin Films: Chemical Composition Engineering and Magnetic Properties;234CF38D-413E-4E50-BCC6-7B41C0CFBEDF;171003

Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) is Ser/Thr protein kinase highly expressed in medulloblastoma (MB) patient samples which promotes cell migration and invasiveness downstream of growth factor receptors. Although MAP4K4 implication in the control of the membrane protrusions at the leading edge of cells during migration and invasion in MB is established, its downstream effectors governing and mediating this process in MB have not been identified. In this study we explored the proteomic neighborhood of MAP4K4 in MB cells and to identify candidate potentially affecting its activity and pro-migratory functions. Towards this aim, we expressed BioID fused versions of MAP4K4(N- and C-terminal) in HEK-293T cells under presence of biotin. In the control setup, we expressed the BioID enzyme alone. After Streptavidin purification of biotinylated proteins, we performed mass spectrometry and quantified relative abundances compared to control conditions.;Baumgartner, Martin;PXD031863;2022-08-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD031863;Pride;BioID proximity labelling of MAP4K4 interactors in HEK-293T cells;E4D36B6B-5C09-49EA-9A2E-A08A056D160A;202245

We enriched for biotinylated proteins by streptavidin-pull-down and determined the composition by mass-spectrometry. We compared CRISPR/CAS9 control cells and CRISPR/CAS9 MAP4K4 (MAP4K4 depletion) cells under starvation and after 30 min stimulation with 20 ng/ml HGF.

This data package supports empirical analysis of national electricity system transitions and retrospective evaluation of electricity system models in 1990-2019 in 31 European countries, including the EU27, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The data package covers two types of content. Firstly, we provide an annotated list of 528 original data sources and references relevant for retrospective electricity system modeling with emphasis on open-access sources. Secondly, we provide a total of 1359 processed and harmonized data files in a format that is suitable as inputs to electricity system models. Four types of data files are included for each country: (i) a country file documenting national demand and economic data, (ii) technology files describing techno-economic data for each major generation technology in the country's electricity mix, (iii) resource files describing fuel prices and CO2 emissions for each fuel, and (iv) load profiles describing 24-hour national load curves for each available year. We provide these data files as comma-separated files to enable their wider reuse for retrospective evaluation of models as well as for empirical analyses of the European electricity system transitions.;"Jaxa-Rozen, Marc; Trutnevyte, Evelina; Wen, Xin";10.5281/zenodo.6696776;2022-06-23T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/6696776;Zenodo;Historic data of the national electricity system transitions in Europe in 1990–2019 for retrospective evaluation of models;265866EB-B20A-482D-BC12-EF821043B786;186834

"AbstractBackgroundTherapeutic management of epilepsy remains a challenge, since optimal systemic antiseizure medication (ASM) concentrations do not always correlate with improved clinical outcome and minimal side effects. We tested the feasibility of noninvasive real-time breath metabolomics as an extension of traditional therapeutic drug monitoring for patient stratification by simultaneously monitoring drug-related and drug-modulated metabolites.MethodsThis proof-of-principle observational study involved 93 breath measurements of 54 paediatric patients monitored over a period of 2.5 years, along with an adult’s cohort of 37 patients measured in two different hospitals. Exhaled breath metabolome of epileptic patients was measured in real time using secondary electrospray ionisation-high-resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS).Results We show that systemic ASM concentrations could be predicted by the breath test. Total and free valproic acid (VPA, an ASM) is predicted with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.63 and 0.66, respectively. We also find (i) high between- and within-subject heterogeneity in VPA metabolism; (ii) several amino acid metabolic pathways are significantly enriched ( p < 0.01) in patients suffering from side effects; (iii) tyrosine metabolism is significantly enriched ( p < 0.001), with downregulated pathway compounds in non-responders. ConclusionsThese results show that real-time breath analysis of epileptic patients provides reliable estimations of systemic drug concentrations along with risk estimates for drug response and side effects.";"Awchi, Mo; Datta, Alexandre N.; Frey, Urs; García-Gómez, Diego; Imbach, Lukas L.; Kohler, Malcolm; Osswald, Martin; Singh, Kapil Dev; Sinues, Pablo; Usemann, Jakob; van den Anker, Johannes; Ziesenitz, Victoria C.";https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-021-00021-3;2021-12-02T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2400/descriptors;Metabolights;Personalised therapeutic management of epileptic patients guided by pathway-driven breath metabolomics;A9E378FD-209B-4F99-8B90-38F0E2ACBCD5;181300

Low-coverage whole genome sequencing followed by imputation has been proposed as a cost-effective genotyping approach for disease and population genetics studies. However, its competitiveness against SNP arrays is undermined as current imputation methods are computationally expensive and unable to leverage large reference panels.Here, we describe a method, GLIMPSE, for phasing and imputation of low-coverage sequencing datasets from modern reference panels. We demonstrate its remarkable performance across different coverages and human populations. It achieves imputation of a full genome for less than $1, outperforming existing methods by orders of magnitude, with an increased accuracy of more than 20% at rare variants. We also show that 1x coverage enables effective association studies and is better suited than dense SNP arrays to access the impact of rare variations. Overall, this study demonstrates the promising potential of low-coverage imputation and suggests a paradigm shift in the design of future genomic studies.;"Delaneau, Olivier; Rubinacci, Simone";10.5281/zenodo.4078748;2020-10-11T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/odelaneau/GLIMPSE;GLIMPSE;Efficient phasing and imputation of low-coverage sequencing data using large reference panels;BC73E17F-23F9-4978-B055-243185CB1CB2;176977
Embodied models suggest that moral judgments are strongly intertwined with first-hand somatic experiences, with some pointing to disgust, and others arguing for a role of pain/harm. Both disgust and pain are unpleasant, arousing experiences, with strong relevance for survival, but with distinctive sensory qualities and neural channels. Hence, it is unclear if moral cognition interacts with sensory-specific properties of one somatic experience or with supramodal dimensions common to both. Across two experiments, participants evaluated ethical dilemmas and subsequently were exposed to disgusting (olfactory) or painful (thermal) stimulations of matched unpleasantness. We found that moral scenarios enhanced physiological and neural activity to subsequent disgust (but not pain), as further supported by an independently-validated whole-brain signature of olfaction. This effect was mediated by activity in the posterior cingulate cortex triggered by dilemma judgments. Our results thus speak in favor of an association between moral cognition and sensory-specific properties of disgust.;"Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado; Vuilleumier, Patrik";doi: 10.17605/OSF.IO/JKRVP;2020-10-17T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/jkrvp/;Open Science Framework;Does inappropriate behavior hurt or stink?

1. Natural communities commonly contain many different species and functional groups, and multiple types of species interactions act simultaneously, such as competition, predation, commensalism or mutualism. However, experimental and theoretical investigations have generally been limited by focusing on one type of interaction at a time or by a lack of a common methodological and conceptual approach to measure species interactions. 2. We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions. These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an extinction-based model, a relative yield model and two generalized Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated. We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed for the specific methods and apply them to empirical data by experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispecies community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. 3. The relative yield method is, in terms of final biomass production, the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely satisfied in ecological communities. 4. We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict multispecies community dynamics across multiple functional groups. 5. Our work unites available tools to measure species interactions under one framework. This improves our ability to make management-oriented predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem processes across study systems.;"Altermatt, Florian; Carrara, Francesco; Giometto, Andrea; Rinaldo, Andrea; Seymour, Mathew";10.5061/dryad.20cp7;2016-02-26T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.20cp7;Dryad;Inferring species interactions in ecological communities: a comparison of methods at different levels of complexity;AF3A37AB-9E90-4A2D-A2CC-CCAA5902130B;179089
Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents release not only chemical constituents in watersheds, but also containmicroorganisms. Thus, an understanding of what microorganisms are released and howthey changemicrobial communities within natural streams is needed. To characterize the community shifts in streams receiving WWTP effluent, we sampled water-column microorganisms from upstream, downstream, and the effluent of WWTPs located on 23 headwater streams in which no other effluent was released upstream. We characterized the bacterial community by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.Wehypothesized that the downstreamcommunity profilewould be a hydraulicmixture between the twosources (i.e., upstreamand effluent). In ordination analyses, the downstream bacterial community profile was a mixture between the upstream and effluent. For 14 of the sites, the main contribution (N50%) to the downstreamcommunity originated from bacteria in the WWTP effluent and significant shifts in relative abundance of specific sequence variants were detected. These shifts in sequence variants may serve as general bioindicators of wastewater-effluent influenced streams,with a human-gut related Ruminococcus genus displaying the highest shift (30-fold higher abundances downstream). However, not all taxa composition changeswere predicted based on hydraulicmixing alone. Specifically, the decrease of Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast readswas not adequately described by hydraulicmixing. The potential alteration of stream microbial communities via a high inflow of human-gut related bacteria and a decrease in autotrophicfunctional groups resulting fromWWTP effluent creates the potential for general shifts in stream ecosystem function.;"Altermatt, Florian; Deiner, Kristy; Eggen, Rik I.L.; Fenner, Kathrin; Mächler, Elvira; Mansfeldt, Cresten; Schönenberger, Urs; Stamm, Christian; Walser, Jean-Claude";0000-0002-4831-6958;2020-03-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4540304.v1.;Dryad;Microbial community shifts in streams receiving treated wastewater effluent;29331BD9-6999-4205-9A5B-CCB2A6BC42EB;179089

"DNA sampled from the environment (eDNA) is a useful way to uncover biodiversity patterns. By combining a conceptual model and empirical data, we test whether eDNA transported in river networks can be used as an integrative way to assess eukaryotic biodiversity for broad spatial scales and across the land-water interface. Using an eDNA metabarcode approach, we detect 296 families of eukaryotes, spanning 19 phyla across the catchment of a river. We show for a subset of these families that eDNA samples overcome spatial autocorrelation biases associated with the classical community assessments by integrating biodiversity information over space. In addition, we demonstrate that many terrestrial species are detected; thus suggesting eDNA in river water also incorporates biodiversity information across terrestrial and aquatic biomes. Environmental DNA transported in river networks offers a novel and spatially integrated way to assess the total biodiversity for whole landscapes and will transform biodiversity data acquisition in ecology.";"Altermatt, Florian; Deiner, Kristy; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Mächler, Elvira; Walser, Jean-Claude";10.5061/dryad.826kd;2017-10-20T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.826kd;Dryad;Environmental DNA reveals that rivers are conveyer belts of biodiversity information;85B2E414-104C-4609-9F85-8543D38F790A;179089
Range expansions and biological invasions are prime examples of transient processes that are likely impacted by rapid evolutionary changes. As a spatial process, range expansions are driven by dispersal and movement behaviour. While it is widely accepted that dispersal and movement may be context-dependent, for instance density-dependent, and best represented by reaction norms, the evolution of density-dependent movement during range expansions has received little experimental attention. We therefore tested current theory predicting the evolution of increased movement at low densities at range margins using highly replicated and controlled range expansion experiments across multiple genotypes of the protist model system Tetrahymena thermophila. Although rare, we found evolutionary changes during range expansions even in the absence of initial standing genetic variation. Range expansions led to the evolution of negatively density-dependent movement at range margins. In addition, we report the evolution of increased intra-strain competitive ability and concurrently decreased population growth rates in range cores. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding movement and dispersal as evolving reaction norms and plastic life-history traits of central relevance for range expansions, biological invasions and the dynamics of spatially structured systems in general.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Gut, Sereina";10.5061/dryad.36q03;2017-09-26T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.36q03;Dryad;Evolution of density-dependent movement during experimental range expansions;9B7D6224-B64C-4F52-9BC7-82AC66A1E50A;179089
Understanding biological range expansions and invasions is of great ecological and economical interest. Importantly, spatial dynamics can be deeply affected by rapid evolution depending on the ecological context. Using experimental evolution in replicated microcosm landscapes and numerical analyses we show experimentally that the ecological process of range expansions leads to the evolution of increased dispersal. This evolutionary change counter-intuitively feeds back on (macro-)ecological patterns affecting the spatial distribution of population densities. While existing theory suggests that densities decrease from range cores to range margins due to K-selection, we show the reverse to be true when competition is considered explicitly including resource dynamics. We suggest that a dispersal-foraging trade-off, leading to more ‘prudent’ foraging at range margins, is the driving mechanism behind the macroecological pattern reported. In conclusion, rapid multi-trait evolution and eco-evolutionary feedbacks are highly relevant for understanding macroecological patterns and designing appropriate conservation strategies.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.";10.5061/dryad.6246r;2016-02-16T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6246r;Dryad;Eco-evolutionary feedbacks during experimental range expansions;9D5130C1-4E27-4D49-8083-838D2854BB55;179089
1. Understanding the consequences of spatial structure on ecological dynamics is a central theme in ecology. Recently, research has recognized the relevance of river and river-analogue network structures, because these systems are not only highly diverse but also rapidly changing due to habitat modifications or species invasions. 2. Much of the previous work on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in metapopulations and metacommunities in dendritic river networks has been either using comparative approaches or was purely theoretical. However, the use of microcosm experiments provides the unique opportunity to study large-scale questions in a causal and experimental framework. 3. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments, in which we manipulated the spatially explicit network configuration of a landscape and addressed how linear versus dendritic connectivity affects population dynamics, specifically the spatial distribution of population densities, and movement behavior of the protist model organism Tetrahymena pyriformis. We tracked population densities and individual-level movement behavior of thousands of individuals over time. 4. At the end of the experiment, we found more variable population densities between patches in dendritic networks compared to linear networks, as predicted by theory. Specifically, in dendritic networks, population densities were higher at nodes that connected to headwaters compared to the headwaters themselves and to more central nodes in the network. These differences follow theoretical predictions and emerged from the different network topologies per se. These differences in population densities emerged despite weakly density-dependent movement. 5. We show that differences in network structure alone can cause characteristic spatial variation in population densities. While such differences have been postulated by theoretical work and are the underlying precondition for differential dispersal evolution in heterogeneous networks, our results may be the first experimental demonstration thereof. Furthermore, these population-level dynamics may affect extinction risks and can upscale to previously shown metacommunity level diversity dynamics. Given that many species in natural river systems exhibit strong spatio-temporal patterns in population densities, our work suggests that abundance patterns should not only be addressed from a local environmental perspective, but may be the outcome of processes that are inherently driven by the respective habitat network structure.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.";10.5061/dryad.4588p;2018-05-18T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.4588p;Dryad;Dispersal in dendritic networks: ecological consequences on the spatial distribution of population densities;5E5B839E-C6F9-40B7-B19E-72DD93B58B69;179089
Dispersal can strongly influence ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Besides the direct contribution of dispersal to population dynamics, dispersers often differ in their phenotypic attributes from non-dispersers, which leads to dispersal syndromes. The consequences of such dispersal syndromes have been widely explored at the population and community level, however, to date, ecosystem-level effects remain unclear. Here, we examine whether dispersing and resident individuals of two different aquatic keystone invertebrate species have different contributions to detrital processing, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. Using experimental two-patch systems, we found no difference in leaf consumption rates with dispersal status of the common native species Gammarus fossarum. In Dikerogammarus villosus, however, a Ponto-Caspian species now expanding throughout Europe, dispersers consumed leaf litter at roughly three times the rate of non-dispersers. Furthermore, this put the contribution of dispersing D. villosus to leaf litter processing on par with native G. fossarum, after adjusting for differences in organismal size. Given that leaf litter decomposition is a key function in aquatic ecosystems, and the rapid species turnover in freshwater habitats with range expansions of non-native species, this finding suggests that dispersal syndromes may have important consequences for ecosystem functioning.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Little, Chelsea J.";10.5061/dryad.8b9j040;2019-02-18T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8b9j040;Dryad;Dispersal syndromes can impact ecosystem functioning in spatially structured freshwater populations;7D63B695-EBD4-46C5-9A5F-734D6E7A0997;179089
A major focus of ecology is to understand and predict ecosystem function across scales. Many ecosystem functions are only measured at local scales, while their effects occur at a landscape level. Here, we investigate how landscape-scale predictions of ecosystem function depend on intraspecific competition, a fine-scale process, by manipulating intraspecific density of shredding macroinvertebrates and examining effects on leaf litter decomposition, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. For two species, we found that per-capita leaf processing rates declined with increasing density following power functions with negative exponents, likely due to interference competition. To demonstrate consequences of this nonlinearity, we scaled up estimates of leaf litter processing from shredder abundance surveys in 10 replicated headwater streams. In accordance with Jensen’s inequality, applying density-dependent consumption rates reduced estimates of catchment-scale leaf consumption by an order of magnitude relative to density-independent rates. Density-dependent consumption estimates aligned closely with metabolic requirements in catchments with large, but not small, shredder populations. Importantly, shredder abundance was not limited by leaf litter availability and catchment-level leaf litter supply was much higher than estimated consumption. Thus leaf litter processing was not limited by resource supply. Our work highlights the need for scaling-up which accounts for intraspecific interactions.;"Altermatt, Florian; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Little, Chelsea J.";10.5061/dryad.3124p62;2020-09-16T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.3124p62;Dryad;Nonlinear effects of intraspecific competition alter landscape-wide scaling up of ecosystem function;4BB08A8A-5F25-449E-9498-801C127E601A;179089

Over recent decades, the oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) of the ocean have expanded, affecting marine ecosystems. However, their response to future global warming is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate Cenozoic ODZs dynamics extending back to 60 million years ago (60 Ma) with a special focus on two periods of sustained global warming: the Middle Miocene and Early Eocene climate optima (MMCO, ca. 16 Ma and EECO, ca 52 Ma). The data series include new species-specific, genus-specific and mixed-taxa foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotope (FB-δ15N) and N content data from sediment cores in the Pacific (ODP 872) and Atlantic (DSDP 516). The new FB-δ15N data combined with existing data from Kast et al., 2019 (doi: 10.1126/science.aau5784) are used to reconstruct the history of ODZ hosted water column denitrification across the Cenozoic. To better understand the connection between denitrification change and climate, we compare the nitrogen isotope data with new TEX86-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data from high latitudes (ODP 704), middle latitudes (DSDP/ODP 516, 588, 754, 1146, 1263) and low latitudes (ODP 667,730) in combination with a global Cenozoic TEX86-derived SST compilation of published records. The data series include all GDGT measurements, calculated indices, SSTs and SST gradients, as well as the age models for the discussed core sites (DSDP/ODP 516, 588, 667, 690, 704, 730, 738, 754, 1146, 1211, 1263) updated to the Geologic Time Scale 2012 (GTS-12, Gradstein et al., 2012, doi: 10.1016/C2011-1-08249-8).;Auderset, Alexandra;10.1594/PANGAEA.943130;2022-08-05T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.943130;Pangaea;Cenozoic foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotope records, TEX86-derived global SST compilation, and GTS-12 adjusted age models from multiple ODP/DSDP sites;CE831EB8-6202-40C9-86C0-A414053D433F;200000

The COVID-19 infection, even in its mild or moderate respiratory forms, can lead to neuropsychological deficits. The COVID-COG project was implemented during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, in response to the questioning at the time concerning the impact that an infection could have on neuropsychological abilities. The project aims at identifying neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric deficits in post-COVID-19 patients and determining if those deficits are associated with the severity of respiratory symptoms in the acute phase and/or with the personal experience of the infection as well as the pandemic context. The project features an exhaustive neuropsychological evaluation, as well as MRI, olfactory and neurological assessments, administered 6-9 months and 12-15 months post infection. For this project, we collaborated with eight departments of the University Hospitals of Geneva, the Leenaards Memory Centre at the Lausanne University Hospital and the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. Finally, the project was funded by the Swiss National Foundation (NRP 78 2020 to 2022 - Grant N°: 4078P0_198438).How to cite:- If you are using the behavioural dataset, please cite: Voruz, P., et al.

"The data set contains scales (rating items) on the willingness of the Swiss resident population to take risks in connection with touristic travel during the coronavirus pandemic. The data includes a selection of items of the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT) (Weber et al., 2002). The data contains measures of the health belief model (HBM; Rosenstock, 1960, see also Champion & Skinner, 2008) that is used both in health research and in tourism research to explain and predict the preventive health behaviour of individuals. Furthermore, the data covers all three elements of the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). This is a representative data set for the Swiss population aged 18 and above. A trilingual and national survey of the Swiss resident population was carried out in the period from March to May 2021. A letter of invitation to participate in the study was sent by post to a total of 4,530 randomly selected persons residing in Switzerland. The address data was provided by the Federal Statistical Office (BfS). Of the total of 4,530 people contacted, 164 were reported as unreachable (no longer at the address, deceased, or due to old age). A total of 1,683 persons participated in the survey.

Anopheles gambiae (Keele Strain) mosquitoes were infected in the lab with cultured Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes (PfN54) to generate oocyst and sporozoite infected vectors. Controls, uninfected mosquitoes, were generated by feeding mosquitoes on the same blood after gametogenesis had occurred which was triggered by dropping the temperature in the glass feeders to below 30 degrees Celsius. After feeding, mosquitoes were kept for 7 and 14 days to allow parasite development after which each individual mosquito was scanned with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and stored at -20 until processed by qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) for confirmation of infection and quantification of parasite load. The data shared is composed of all the spectra that were collected (in .spc format for GRAMS IQ software) labeled with a unique identifier which links to the STATA files where the mean number of parasite genomes and age for each individual mosquito are listed. The files used to generate the calibration through partial least square (PLS) regression on GRAMS IQ have also been shared (.tfdx) along with the calibration file (.cal) for uploading on IQ Predict software.

Based on the hypothesis that, enhancing the local concentration of donor oligos could increase the correction rates, we generated and tested novel CRISPR-Cas9 systems, in which the DNA repair template is covalently conjugated to Cas9 (RNPD system). To validate our results from the HEK293T reporter cells, we here tested our approach at different endogenous genomic loci and in different cell types. We first targeted the human beta globin (HBB) locus in the K562 cell line, and analyzed correction- and editing frequencies using next generation sequencing (NGS). Next we targeted the Rosa26 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9) locus in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Here, RNPD system was always compared to Cas9 SNAP-tag fusion proteins with uncoupled donor oligos. To also directly compare the engineered RNPD system to the classical CRISPR-Cas9 system, we performed experiments where we used wild-type Cas9 with the uncoupled donor oligos as a control. We therefore targeted the fluorescent reporter locus as well as the endogenous loci HBB, empty spiracles homeobox 1 (EMX1), and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in HEK293T cells. Finally, we performed the analysis of three computationally predicted off-target sites of the reporter locus.;Savic, Natasa;E-MTAB-6808;2018-06-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6808/;ArrayExpress;E-MTAB-6808 - Covalent linkage of the DNA repair template to the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease enhances homology-directed repair;EDBC195C-C531-4C0C-B96A-F4E301616A59;171388

"For over 100 years, popular and scientific communities have suggested that colours have psychological and affective implications (Kaya & Epps, 2004; Major, 1895; Wexner, 1954). Yet, most claims remain unsubstantiated, including the assumption that the actual perception of colour is a key ingredient to any such supposed implication. Since 2015, we have been systematically studying and publishing results on colour-emotion associations for colour terms and colour patches using the same overall methodology, testing different populations. We could already show that emotion associations with colour terms are highly consistent across different cultures, but that consistencies are even higher when cultures share borders and languages (Jonauskaite, Abdel-Khalek, et al., 2019; Jonauskaite, Abu-Akel, et al., 2020; Jonauskaite, Wicker, et al., 2019). For a Swiss sample, we also found high consistencies for emotion associations with colour terms and colour patches (Jonauskaite, Parraga, et al., 2020). These results indicate that such associations are majorly driven by conceptual mechanism.To elaborate on this latter point, we manipulated perceptual colour experience by testing individuals with and without congenital red-green colour-blindness. The first group experiences colour perception deficiencies, but both groups’ conceptual knowledge is comparable. We asked congenital red-green colour-blind (n = 64) and non-colour-blind (n = 66) men to associate 12 colours with 20 emotion concepts, and rate the emotion intensities. About half of each group provided associations with colour terms, the remainder with colour patches. We found that colour-blind and non-colour-blind men associated similar emotions with colours, irrespective of whether colours were conveyed via terms (r = .82) or patches (r = .80). No differences occurred when we categorised emotions according to valence, arousal, and power. Of interest, the colour-emotion associations and the emotion intensities were not modulated by participants’ severity of colour-blindness (CBI). Hinting at some additional, although minor, role of actual colour perception, the consistencies in associations for words and patches were higher in non-colour-blind than colour-blind men.Together, these results suggest that colour-emotion associations in adults are driven more importantly by conceptual mechanisms than direct perceptual experience of colour. Therefore, intact colour vision is not essential for having shared colour-emotion associations. The current findings add to a growing body of literature that colour-emotion associations represent another psychological universal.";"Jonauskaite, Domicele; Mohr, Christine";https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/17358/0/;2021-11-03T00:00:00Z;https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/17358/0/;FORSbase;" Colour-emotion associations in individuals with and without congenital red-green colour-blindness";4F800C8D-F53D-4BA5-89A1-2B189ACDBAB4;175055
"In 2015, an ambiguous picture of a Dress triggered popular and scientific interest as different people perceive it having widely different colours. To help understand this phenomenon, we performed two studies. First, few days after the Dress appeared on the Internet, we projected the Dress to 240 students on a large screen (Experiment 1). The distribution of different colour perceivers partially confirms previous reports with the majority reporting seeing the Dress in blue and black (B&B; 48%) or white and gold (W&G; 38%). The third group of blue and brown (B&Br; 7%) viewers also emerged, and is worth further consideration. In a second, laboratory study, 57 participants used a computerized colour picker to precisely match colours of small squares (a) and vertical strips (b) cut out of the Dress picture, and the original Dress picture (c) (Experiment 2). Results indicated that lightness and chroma values of matched colours changed from B&B to B&Br to W&G viewers in contextualized images (b, c) only. Irrespective of viewer type or context conditions, the hues of the matched colours were either blue-purple (light parts of the Dress) or orange-yellow (dark parts). Finally, colours matched by B&B viewers were the closest to the colours displayed on the ambiguous Dress picture as compared to other viewer types. Our research supports the notion that the Dress effect emerges from differences in perceived lightness and chroma, but not hue. This phenomenon only occurs when all aspects of the picture are integrated, highlighting the importance of contextual information within the ambiguous Dress image.";"Jonauskaite, Domicele; Mohr, Christine";https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/15066/0/;2017-11-03T00:00:00Z;https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/15066/0/;FORSbase;The ambiguous #Dress image illusion;E88022BF-31FF-492D-93BD-90DAABFE95FE;175055

A main puzzle in the sovereign debt literature is that defaults have only minor effects on subsequent borrowing costs and access to credit. This paper comes to a different conclusion. We construct the first complete database of investor losses (“haircuts”) in all restructurings with foreign banks and bondholders from 1970 until 2010, covering 180 cases in 68 countries. We then show that restructurings involving higher haircuts are associated with significantly higher subsequent bond yield spreads and longer periods of capital market exclusion. The results cast doubt on the widespread belief that credit markets “forgive and forget.” (JEL E43, F34, G15, H63);"Cruces, Juan J; Trebesch, Christoph";CrucesTrebesch2013;2013-07-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.5.3.85;CrucesTrebesch2013;Sovereign Defaults: The Price of Haircuts;C605F417-119F-47D9-80CF-83A7EFFE2063;199469

Many DHS surveys are geo-coded, thus providing a set of spatial sampling points containing local ethnic composition estimates. We use methods from geo-statistics and machine learning to estimate the ethnic composition of areas in between these sampling points to produce a continuous map of ethnic compositions for each surveyed country.;Müller-Crepon, Carl;https://icr.ethz.ch/data/side/;;https://icr.ethz.ch/data/side/;https://icr.ethz.ch/data/side/;Spatially Interpolated Data on Ethnicity - SIDE;D54067E5-4700-4E00-998C-CF858DD596FF;165233

Transmission of malaria parasites from humans to the mosquito vector exclusively relies on the sexual reproduction of the parasite within the mosquito blood meal. Upon ingestion, Plasmodium male gametocyte undergoes explosive development: within 10 minutes, it completes three rounds of genome replication and endomitosis, assembles eight axonemes, and emerges from the host red blood cell. The plant-like calcium-dependent protein kinase 4 (CDPK4) was previously shown to be essential for male gametogenesis placing this kinase as an attractive drug target to block malaria transmission. Here we have identified and resolved three distinct molecular functions of CDPK4 during male gametogenesis. Activity of a myristoylated isoform is first required up to 20 seconds after activation to load the Mini-Chromosome Maintenance complex onto origins of replication. This role is partially mediated by a conserved protein belonging to the SAPS-domain family which is involved in the G1 to S-phase transition in eukaryotes. At the same time, activity of myristoylated CDPK4 is required to phosphorylate a Plasmodium-specific microtubule-associated protein necessary for mitotic spindle assembly. Finally, activity of a short non-myristoylated isoform of CDPK4 is essential seconds prior to completion of cytokinesis and the activation of male gamete motility. This late role has been linked to another Plasmodium-specific protein that is incorporated into axonemes during gametogenesis. This study reveals how a kinase of a protist parasite integrates and transduces multiple signals with a high spatiotemporal resolution to control both evolutionarily conserved and Plasmodium-specific biological processes.;Choudhary, Jyoti;PXD005884;2017-05-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD005884;PRIDE;CDPK4 is a pleiotropic regulator controlling the atypical Plasmodium cell cycle during mosquito transmission;147A54A8-1DA7-40B9-8F6F-83A7060BCF69;155852
Cell-cycle transitions are generally triggered by variations in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria parasites express ancestral CDKs and cyclins, whose functions and interdependency remain elusive. Here, we show that the unique Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical cell-cycle regulator of gametogony required for transmission to the mosquito. It is essential for DNA replication and phosphorylates canonical S/TPxK CDK motifs on components of the pre-replicative complex otherwise regulated by distinct kinases in other eukaryotes. Over a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Haemosporidia-specific cyclin (SOC2) with no evidence of SOC2 degradation. Regulation of CRK5 activity relies instead on dynamic phosphorylation of a C-terminus extension that mediates its interaction with SOC2. Our results present evidence that during the atypical cell cycles of Plasmodium gametogony, a unique and divergent cyclin/CDK pair fulfils the functional space of multiple eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases to initiate DNA replication.;Hainard, Alexandre;PXD17283;2020-02-18T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017283;PRIDE;A unique and divergent cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex controls DNA replication during atypical cell-cycles of Plasmodium berghei gametogony;034FFC0C-E337-4DA9-A232-1433CF919A40;155852
Massive online data repository with sophisticated interactive user interface containing the full simulations of the planetary population syntheses with the Bern model of planet formation and evolution. It is to the best of our knowledge the only existing database where planetary formation and evolution tracks for entire planetary populations are available online. The user has the possibility to select planets with certain properties (like an observed properties), and then DACE displays model planets that agree with these constraints, showing how the planet and planetary system has evolved from its origins to present day.The data accessibility policy is that once the paper presenting the data is published, the data becomes available also online on DACE.DACE is a platform of the NCCR PlanetS and is offered free of charge to the PlanetsInTime research group. It is developed by three professional software engineers and offers a degree of sophistication that can only be reached by professional developers. The NCCR does thus help to multiply the impact of the PlanetsInTime project.;Mordasini, Christoph;Not yet avilable - but each data set has a unique identifer and meta information is available online;2020-05-31T00:00:00Z;https://dace.unige.ch/populationSearch/;DACE - Data and analysis center for exoplanets;Planetary population syntheses on DACE;A0BEB724-7275-4473-AB00-AC1AB71D6327;155816
As a first step in the transmission of malaria, Plasmodium parasites ingested by a mosquito must rapidly initiate a gametogenesis process prior to sexual reproduction. The phosphorylation-based signalling mechanisms underlying the initiation of this process remain largely unmapped. We have measured a high-resolution time course of phosphorylation in P. berghei gametocytes during the first minute of gametogenesis to elucidate the scope and dynamics of the response. The data reveals rapid phosphoregulation of microtubule motor proteins and DNA replication initiation proteins within the first 18 s and of DNA replication machinery by 60 s. The data also implicate several protein kinases and phosphatases in the gametogenesis signalling pathway. Through gene knock-out experiments, we verify that the protein kinases CDPK4 and SRPK1 have distinct influences over the phosphorylation of similar downstream targets. Together, the results show that key cell-cycle systems related to both replication and mitosis undergo simultaneous, rapid phosphoregulation.;Choudhary, Jyoti;PXD006266;2017-11-29T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006266;PRIDE;Sub-minute Phosphoregulation of Cell Cycle Systems during Plasmodium Gamete Formation;067C815B-42A6-4E37-A6E7-9050D8889C6A;155852
In malaria parasites, evolution of parasitism has been linked to functional optimisation. Despite this optimisation, most members of a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family show genetic redundancy during erythrocytic proliferation. To identify relationships between phospho-signalling pathways, we here screen 294 genetic interactions among protein kinases in Plasmodium berghei. This reveals a synthetic negative interaction between a hypomorphic allele of the protein kinase G (PKG) and CDPK4 to control erythrocyte invasion which is conserved in P. falciparum. CDPK4 becomes critical when PKG-dependent calcium signals are attenuated to phosphorylate proteins important for the stability of the inner membrane complex, which serves as an anchor for the acto-myosin motor required for motility and invasion. Finally, we show that multiple kinases functionally complement CDPK4 during erythrocytic proliferation and transmission to the mosquito vector. This study reveals how CDPKs are wired within a stage-transcending signalling network to control motility and host cell invasion in malaria parasites.;Brochet, Mathieu;PXD011096;2018-09-17T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011096;PRIDE;Epistasis studies reveal redundancy among calcium-dependent protein kinases in motility and invasion of malaria parasites;924F35E5-54F0-4577-B3C1-5479B1C318B6;155852

Toxoplasma gondii is able to establish a life-long chronic infection in human and animals. Host cell entry and egress from infected cells are two key steps in the lytic cycle of this obligate intracellular parasite that ensures its survival and dissemination. Egress is a temporally orchestrated process underpinned by the regulated exocytosis of the apical secretory organelles, termed micronemes. At any point during intracellular replication, deleterious environmental changes resulting from a loss of host cell integrity can trigger egress via the activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG). Remarkably, even in the absence of extrinsic alarming signals, the parasites naturally egress from infected cells in a coordinated manner after ca. 5 to 6 cycles of binary fission. Here we show that diacylglycerol kinase 2 (DGK2) is secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole where it produces phosphatidic (PA), which acts as intrinsic signal to elicit natural egress. PA activates a large guanylate cyclase (GC) receptor uniquely conserved in apicomplexans and composed of one P4-ATPase and two guanylate cyclase domains. Assembly of a functional GC at the parasite plasma membrane critically depends on the association with two proteins acting as cofactors. This study reveals the existence of a unique and versatile signaling platform able to respond to an intrinsic lipid mediator and other extrinsic alarming signals to control programmed and induced egress, respectively.;Brochet, Mathieu;PXD011692;2018-11-14T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD011692;PRIDE;Phosphatidic acid governs natural egress in Toxoplasma gondii via a guanylate cyclase receptor platform;2CF1A300-FEE0-4DE4-BE7E-D2B05033157E;155852
Cell-cycle transitions are generally triggered by variations in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria-causing parasites have evolved unique cell-cycles with a repertoire of ancestral CDKs and cyclins whose functions and interdependency remain elusive. Here, we show that the divergent Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical cell-cycle regulator of gametogony required for transmission to the mosquito. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs on components of the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. We also provide evidence for indirect regulation of the concomitant progression through M-phase. Over a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Plasmodium-specific cyclin (SOC2) with no evidence of SOC2 cycling through transcription, translation nor degradation.

Cell cycle transitions are generally triggered by variation in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria-causing parasites have a life cycle with unique cell-division cycles, and a repertoire of divergent CDKs and cyclins of poorly understood function and interdependency. We show that Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical regulator of atypical mitosis in the gametogony and is required for mosquito transmission. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs of components in the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. We also provide evidence for indirect regulation of the concomitant M-phase progression. During a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Plasmodium-specific cyclin (SOC2), although we obtained no evidence of SOC2 cycling by transcription, translation or degradation.

Toxoplasma gondii encodes three Protein Kinase A catalytic (PKAc1-3) and one regulatory (PKAr) subunits to integrate cAMP-dependent signals. Here, we show that inactive PKAc1 is maintained at the parasite pellicle by interacting with dually acylated PKAr. Either a conditional knockdown of PKAr or the overexpression of PKAc1 results in a block in parasite division. In contrast, conditional expression of a dominant negative PKAr isoform unable to bind cAMP, triggers premature egress of parasites from infected cells. This untimely egress critically depends on parasite density and host cell acidification. A comparative phosphoproteome analysis reveals that PKA genetic inhibition significantly changed the phosphorylation profile of a putative cGMP-phosphodiesterase, PDE2. Consistently, the phenotype of PKA genetic inhibition is alleviated by chemical inhibition of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG). A phosphodiesterase inhibitor is able to circumvent egress repression by PKA or pH neutralisation, indicating that environmental acidification and PKA signalling act as balancing regulators of cGMP degradation to control PKG-mediated egress. Collectively, these results reveal a cross-talk between PKA and PKG pathways to govern egress in T. gondii.;Choudhary, Jyoti;PXD006045;2017-10-12T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006045;PRIDE;Cross-talk between PKA and PKG controls pH-dependent host cell egress of Toxoplasma gondii;677FEDB7-EA22-4E41-B455-E892C03DD1ED;155852

AbstractVisual Localization is one of the key enabling technologies for autonomous driving and augmented reality. High quality datasets with accurate 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) reference poses are the foundation for benchmarking and improving existing methods. Traditionally, reference poses have been obtained via Structure-from-Motion (SfM). However, SfM itself relies on local features which are prone to fail when images were taken under different conditions, e.g., day/night changes. At the same time, manually annotating feature correspondences is not scalable and potentially inaccurate. In this work, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate reference poses based on feature matching between renderings of a 3D model and real images via learned features. Given an initial pose estimate, our approach iteratively refines the pose based on feature matches against a rendering of the model from the current pose estimate. We significantly improve the nighttime reference poses of the popular Aachen Day-Night dataset, showing that state-of-the-art visual localization methods perform better (up to 47%) than predicted by the original reference poses. We extend the dataset with new nighttime test images, provide uncertainty estimates for our new reference poses, and introduce a new evaluation criterion. We will make our reference poses and our framework publicly available upon publication.;"Sattler, Torsten; Scaramuzza, Davide; Zhang, Zichao";https://www.visuallocalization.net/;2020-12-23T00:00:00Z;https://www.visuallocalization.net/;Long-term visual localization;Reference Pose Generation for Long-term Visual Localization via Learned Features and View Synthesis;CD7DDFD1-7A7D-4C53-AC83-7E7AC0D20A55;155841

"The ISSP HEALTH PILOT survey is the pilot survey of the 2011 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) module on health, health policies and inequalities in health. The ISSP survey is carried out in more than 40 countries worldwide. Each edition of the ISSP covers a specific theme, which is repeated at regular intervals. In Switzerland, the ISSP is part of the MOSAICH survey (Measurement and Observation of Social Attitudes in Switzerland. The ISSP HEALTH PILOT survey interviewed several hundred people living in the canton of Vaud in late 2009 and early 2010; it is preliminary to the MOSAiCH2011 survey, which interviews a representative sample of the resident population in Switzerland. The survey focuses on public opinion on the prioritization of resources and health care as well as on the confidence in and the satisfaction with the health care system. It looks at different dimensions: self-rated health status and well-being, personal experience with health care, confidence in the health care system, importance to be put on different health sectors, and satisfaction with the current system and its benefits.

MOSAiCH stands for “Measurement and Observation of Social Attitudes in Switzerland” and is a survey conducted under this name since 2005. It integrates several international repeated surveys, with Swiss data going back as far as 1987. In practice, a minimum of 1,200 people answer a 1-hour face-to-face interview, with the survey being conducted every two years. The data offer valuable information about attitudes and behaviours of the resident population of Switzerland, with strong analytical power for sociological research.The questionnaire is structured in five parts: (1+2) At the heart of MOSAiCH stands the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). This longstanding survey includes today 45 countries all over the world. As the fieldwork of MOSAiCH takes place every two years, two modules of the ISSP are included in each survey. There are currently 12 different modules, regularly repeated for comparisons over time. (3) Thesocio-demographic part is designed to meet the ISSP requirements, and is further elaborated to improve the analytical power. (4) An additional part of the survey takes over certain repeated parts of the standard Eurobarometer, adapted to the Swiss context, especially the attitudes toward political and social institutions and issues related to the European Union. (5) A last part is open for propositions of Swissscholars, which have to be related to the topics of the fielded survey.For the edition in 2015, the ISSP modules are on the repeated topics “Citizenship (II)” and “Work orientations (IV)”. The questions for the last part have been determined by a call for proposals. The additional questions in the Face-to-Face questionnaire are related to National identity, gender role and work complexity. The drop-off questionnaire is related to family network.;"Ernst Stähli, Michèle; Joye, Dominique; Nisple, Karin; Ochsner, Michael; Pollien, Alexandre; Sapin, Marlène; van den Hende, Anthe";https://doi.org/10.23662/FORS-DS-683-3;2016-02-01T00:00:00Z;https://forsbase.unil.ch/;FORSbase;MOSAiCH: Befragung zur Staatsbürgerschaft und zum Sinn der Arbeit - 2015 [Dataset];8E9B68AB-5548-43E0-A1FC-4E9ECF27E73A;151002
Named MOSAiCH since 2005, this project carries out the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and Eurobarometer surveys in Switzerland every second year. The survey is designed to allow comparative analyses both geographically and over time. The composition of the questions remains largely unchanged and includes a recurrent socio-political part, two ISSP modules, a wave-specific topic initiated by the Swiss researchers and a detailed socio-demographic part. The specific modules of the 2011 edition include:- ISSP 2010: Environment III- ISSP 2011: Health I (especially health policy)- Additional international questions ISSP 2010 and 2011- Additional Swiss questions on the environment (partly from the Swiss Environmental Survey 2007 carried out by ETH Zurich)- Trust in institutions, Swiss politics and attitude towards Europe - Socio-demographic questions- Additional questions: survey climate, telephony;FORS, Centre de compétence;https://doi.org/10.23662/FORS-DS-587-2;2018-03-22T00:00:00Z;https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/15324/0/;FORSbase;MOSAiCH: Enquête sur la santé, l'environnement et la politique - 2011 [Dataset];E2F05FCC-478B-44D4-929E-A021EDFCBF80;128919

The perinatal period is a critical window for the distribution of innate tissue-resident immune cells to developing organs. Despite epidemiologic evidence implicating early life environment in risk for allergy, temporally controlled lineage-tracing of ILC2s during this period has not been done. Using complementary fate-mapping approaches and fluorescent reporters of ILC2 activation, we demonstrate that ILC2s appear in multiple organs during late gestation similar to tissue macrophages, but unlike the latter, a majority of peripheral ILC2 pools are generated de novo during a postnatal window. This period was accompanied by systemic ILC2 priming and acquisition of tissue-specific expression profiles. Although perinatal ILC2s are variably replaced with age, the dramatic increases in tissue ILC2s following helminth infection are mediated through local expansion independent of de novo generation by BM hematopoiesis. We provide the first comprehensive temporally controlled fate-mapping of an innate lymphocyte subset with notable nuances as compared to tissue macrophage ontogeny;"Lee, Jinwoo; Locksley, Richard; Schneider, Christoph";GSE126924;2019-04-15T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126924;Gene Expression Omnibus;Layered ontogeny and in situ perinatal priming of tissue ILC2s;24035730-DA71-4D6B-A134-3ACDAA8A4599;180832

Prolonged cell cycle arrests occur naturally in differentiated cells and in response to various stresses such as nutrient deprivation or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Whether and how cells survive prolonged cell cycle arrests is not clear. Here, we used S. cerevisiae to compare physiological cell cycle arrests and genetically induced arrests in G1-, meta- and anaphase. Prolonged cell cycle arrest led to growth attenuation in all studied conditions, coincided with activation of the Environmental Stress Response (ESR) and with a reduced ribosome content as determined by whole ribosome purification and TMT mass spectrometry. Suppression of the ESR through hyperactivation of the Ras/PKA pathway reduced cell viability during prolonged arrests, demonstrating a cytoprotective role of the ESR. Attenuation of cell growth and activation of stress induced signaling pathways also occur in arrested human cell lines, raising the possibility that the response to prolonged cell cycle arrest is conserved.;Neurohr, Gabriel;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000602269;2023-03-09T00:00:00Z;https://libdrive.ethz.ch/index.php/s/GCpP8ripHJayLhC;ETH Zurich Research Collection;The environmental stress response regulates ribosome content in cell cycle-arrested S. cerevisiae;33F68058-B99E-4CF6-B61C-6C5BA688EA5D;187003

They start from Wikipedia words and phrases under the tag “List of environmental organisations topics” and “List of environmental issues”. I further process them by removing words that are often used in contexts beyond environment, adding top 40 closest synonyms with a word embedding model, and finally removing words that do not express environment concerns or supports based on google search results.

Most multicellular organisms have a major body cavity that harbors immune cells. In primordial species like purple sea urchins, these cells perform phagocytic functions but are also crucial in repairing injuries. In mammals, the peritoneal cavity contains large numbers of resident GATA6+ macrophages, which may play a similar role. It is unclear how cavity macrophages suspended in the fluid phase (peritoneal fluid) identify and migrate towards injuries, however. Here, we show that cavity macrophages in fluid rapidly form thrombus-like structures in response to injury using primordial scavenger receptor (SRCR) domains. Aggregates of cavity macrophages physically sealed injuries and promoted rapid repair of focal lesions. In iatrogenic surgical situations, these cavity macrophages formed extensive aggregates that promoted the growth of intra-abdominal scar tissue termed peritoneal adhesions.;Zindel, Joel;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.05qfttf1w;;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.05qfttf1w;Dryad;Primordial GATA6 macrophages function as extravascular platelets in sterile injury;98C6E221-BFAA-478A-9670-610025B6798B;181641
Assessor: Jakob WinterParticipants: 12 British farmersDescription: During my investigation on the behavioural mechanisms underlying piling behaviour on British layer flocks, I interviewed 12 British farmers about their experience with piling behaviour. Upon ethical approval by The Royal Veterinary College, interviews with farmers were audio recorded. The audio recordings were transcribed using the Online transcribe function of Microsoft Word. I scanned the audio transcripts for relevant statements of farmers associated with piling behaviour and smothering. Based on these efforts, I could sort the statements into relevant themes. This data set contains the original interview statements of farmers and themes induced by the assessor. This data set provides a unique, highly detailed, and strong ground for further hypotheses for investigating piling behaviour and smothering. This data set will be available as soon as I published my findings.;"Nicol, Christine; Winter, Jakob";*updated after publication;;https://www.re3data.org;www.re3data.org;Qualitative assessment of British farmers perceptions on piling behaviour;7D98FF2D-488C-4477-AF40-6491DFD67AF7;191797

Abstract. With this contribution, we describe and publish two high-quality street-level datasets, captured with a portable high-performance Mobile Mapping System (MMS). The datasets will be freely available for scientific use. Both datasets, from a city centre and a forest represent area-wide street-level reality captures which can be used e.g. for establishing cloud-based frameworks for infrastructure management as well as for smart city and forestry applications. The quality of these data sets has been thoroughly evaluated and demonstrated. For example, georeferencing accuracies in the centimetre range using these datasets in combination with image-based georeferencing have been achieved. Both high-quality multi sensor system street-level datasets are suitable for evaluating and improving methods for multiple tasks related to high-precision 3D reality capture and the creation of digital twins. Potential applications range from localization and georeferencing, dense image matching and 3D reconstruction to combined methods such as simultaneous localization and mapping and structure-from-motion as well as classification and scene interpretation.

Melanoma is the least common but the deadliest of skin cancers. This cancer begins when the genes of a cell suffer damage or fail, and identifying the genes involved in melanoma is crucial for understanding the melanoma tumorigenesis. To date, machine learning for gene-melanoma relation extraction from text has been limited by the lack of annotated resources.  To overcome this problem, we have exploited the information of the Melanoma Gene Database (a manually curated database of human melanoma related genes) to build an annotated dataset of binary relations between genes and melanoma entities mentioned in PubMed abstracts. The exploitability of the dataset was tested with both traditional machine learning, and neural network-based models. These models are then used to automatically extract gene-melanoma relations from the biomedical literature. Researchers can use the annotated dataset to develop and compare their own models. Moreover, the relations extracted from the literature can be integrated with existing structured knowledge to facilitate researchers in their data search.;Zanoli, Roberto;http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/745bpf597f.1;2022-08-30T00:00:00Z;https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/745bpf597f;Mendeley;An annotated dataset for gene-melanoma relation extraction from scientific literature;A730A61F-C880-4AE4-A5EE-61BBE44FE6E3;162758

Infecting large portions of the global population, seasonal influenza is a major burden on societies around the globe. While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, its local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. While we did not find that transmission dynamics in Basel correlate with humidity or school closures, we did find some evidence that it may positively correlated with temperature. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network. In the remaining transmission network, our analyses suggest that school-aged children likely play a more central role than pre-school aged children. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities.;"Augustin, Noémi; Battegay, Manuel; Bedford, Trevor; Brunner, Myrta; Buser, Andreas; Dubuis, Olivier; Egli, Adrian; et al.,; Goldman, Nina; Hadfield, James; Hollenstein, Yvonne; Lang, Brian M.; Lang, Daniela; Müller, Nicola F.; Naegele, Michael; Neher, Richard A.; Nickel, Christian H.; Ritz, Nicole; Saalfrank, Claudia; Sailer, Nadine; Schneider-Sliwa, Rita; Seth-Smith, Helena MB; Syedbasha, Mohammedyaseen; Wüthrich, Daniel; Zeller, Andreas";GenBank accession numbers as in article;2020-11-19T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/;GenBank;Genomic Sequencing Data Influenza;40341B86-FFFA-472D-AF05-05020FE381F9;166258

Rod-shaped bacteria typically grow first via sporadic and dispersed elongation along their lateral walls and then via a combination of zonal elongation and constriction at the division site to form the poles of daughter cells. Although constriction comprises up to half of the cell cycle, its impact on cell size control and homeostasis has rarely been considered. To reveal the roles of cell elongation and constriction in bacterial size regulation during cell division, we captured the shape dynamics of Caulobacter crescentus with time-lapse structured illumination microscopy and used molecular markers as cell-cycle landmarks. We perturbed the constriction rate using a hyperconstriction mutant or fosfomycin ([(2R,3S)-3-methyloxiran-2-yl]phosphonic acid) inhibition. We report that the constriction rate contributes to both size control and homeostasis, by determining elongation during constriction and by compensating for variation in pre-constriction elongation on a single-cell basis.;"Archetti, Anna; Goley, Erin; Holden, Seamus; Lambert, Ambroise; Laub, Michael T.; Manley, Suliana; Pincus, Zachary; Schaber, Felix; Vanhecke, Aster";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2018.05.020;2018-06-01T00:00:00Z;https://10.5281/zenodo.1248441 and 10.5281/zenodo.1241005;Zenodo;Constriction Rate Modulation Can Drive Cell Size Control and Homeostasis in C. crescentus;35AD192E-5716-4599-939D-C4B24F8EFD97;166330

The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) is especially important, because it is more frequently preserved and somewhat decoupled from dietary function. Researchers have used the EDJ to test hypotheses of human evolution, but this trait has not yet been comprehensively studied across modern human populations. This study is the largest investigation of EDJ morphology in modern humans to date, spanning 161 archaeological individuals from six continents. These data demonstrate that the EDJ evolves neutrally, and biomedical imaging of EDJ morphology can therefore be used as a non-invasive method to investigate ancient population movement and human genetic structure.;Monson, Tesla;https://github.com/teslamonson/EDJ;2020-10-06T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/teslamonson/EDJ;github;EDJ;257463D3-3BCB-4D21-95F1-C6C4AF3A0038;166053

A comprehensive database of paleoclimate records is needed to place recent warming into the longer-term context of natural climate variability. We present a global compilation of quality-controlled, published, temperature-sensitive proxy records extending back 12,000 years through the Holocene. Data were compiled from 679 sites where time series cover at least 4000 years, are resolved at sub-millennial scale (median spacing of 400 years or finer) and have at least one age control point every 3000 years, with cut-off values slackened in data-sparse regions. The data derive from lake sediment (51%), marine sediment (31%), peat (11%), glacier ice (3%), and other natural archives. The database contains 1319 records, including 157 from the Southern Hemisphere. The multi-proxy database comprises paleotemperature time series based on ecological assemblages, as well as biophysical and geochemical indicators that reflect mean annual or seasonal temperatures, as encoded in the database. This database can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of Holocene temperature at global to regional scales, and is publicly available in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format.;"et al.,; Kaufman, Darrell";10.25921/4RY2-G808;2020-04-14T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/27330;NOAA Paleoclimatology Database;Temperature-12k Database;8CB5D6B8-CB9D-467D-BC74-B73BF303771B;165494

This data article presents a methodology and the corresponding code developed to perform and process stress relaxation tests where samples display superimposed (i) classical, continuous logarithmic relaxation together with (ii) sudden displacements manifest as abrupt stress decreases. The method extracts the activation area characteristic of the thermally activated mechan- ism that drives continuous plastic deformation in the material. We report stress relaxation data appertaining to as-cast (27) and annealed (2) aluminium microwires produced through a micro- casting process. For an interpretation and discussion of the data on annealed microwires the reader is referred to “ The effect of size on the plastic deformation of annealed cast aluminium microwires” (Verheyden et al., In Press) [1].

Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingCells were transfected either with a control plasmid or with plasmids encoding for HySp5 and ZfSp5a proteins. Plasmids encoding for mutant versions of these genes, lacking the DNA binding domain (HySp5-dDBD and ZfSp5-dDBD respectively), were also transfected. In order to evaluate the ability of HySP5 and ZfSp5a proteins to regulate gene expression via cooperation with beta-catenin, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a combination of plasmids encoding for these factors. HEK293 cells were also transfected either with the b-CATENIN coding plasmid alone or with a combination of plasmids encoding for HySp5-dDBD or ZfSp5-dDBD together with b-catenin.;Beccari, Leo;GSE121317;2018-10-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE121317;GEO database;Expression profiling of HEK293T cells expressing HySp5, HySp5-dDBD, ZfSp5 and ZfSp5-dDBD by high throughput sequencing;51BD203E-C11C-46E1-B191-8407B2F1A0AA;169930

The goal of this project is to develop a relatively simple and efficient technique for the recovery of valuable elements from e-waste using microbe-based bio-leaching activities. Microbe-mediated metal bioleaching involves the conversion of metallic compounds into soluble states through the activity of acidophilic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria or bacterial consortia using dedicated leaching devices.The dataset deposited on the Zenodo platform includes the results obtained from experiments carried out during the six months of research on the subject. It includes nine bioleaching experiments carried out using the bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, as well as the microbial consortia HAB and RT8H. The data set presented here is the condensed version of data collected from two bioreactors during the bioleaching of electronic waste (cell phone screens and PCBs), such as physical and chemical measurements, ICP-OES/MS, biomass measurements and metagenomic analyzes. This dataset will be used in a peer-reviewed publication. Note that this set is not yet complete, some results concerning the metagenomic analysis of the two consortia are pending.;Rossi, Pierre;10.5281/zenodo.4722772;2021-05-11T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/deposit/4722772;Zenodo.org;Recovery of critical metals and rare earth elements from electronic waste using bio-mining processes (E-waste biomining);BF375333-B7DD-430B-9D98-631C4254A0C9;190259
"Innovative delivery strategies are needed in order to realize the potential of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in medicine. SiRNAs are short, double-stranded RNA molecules that silence genes by co-opting an endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Because they act on messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences via RNAi, siRNAs hold promise as potentially curative therapies for genetic defects, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and other diseases that cannot be treated with traditional, protein-binding small molecule drugs and biologics. However, key physiological barriers largely have precluded the translation of siRNA drugs into clinical practice. In vivo, naked siRNAs are degraded rapidly by nucleases and cleared by the kidneys, resulting in a half-life of less than five minutes. Moreover, by comparison to small molecule drugs, siRNA drugs are relatively large, hydrophilic molecules that do not distribute widely to tissues or passively cross the cell membrane. Therefore, without an effective strategy for delivery, the accumulation of siRNA drugs at target sites is minimal. Today, there are few prominent siRNA delivery approaches, and each has significant limitations. For example, chemical modifications can improve nuclease resistance, but with the increase in stability also come tradeoffs in potency and safety. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) physically shield siRNAs from degradation and can be modified to promote biodistribution and uptake; but as LNPs are optimized for efficacy, they become increasingly complex, posing quality assurance, cost, and evaluation problems. Finally, conjugation to the N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand is a promising delivery strategy for the liver, but targeted delivery to other tissues is a problem that still remains to be solved. Advances in nucleic acid nanotechnology have shown that RNA is an emerging platform for drug delivery. In particular, a three-way junction (3WJ) derived from bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA) has gained prominence as a vector for small molecule, microRNA (miRNA), anti-miRNA, and siRNA delivery. As a delivery solution for siRNA, RNA-based platforms like the pRNA 3WJ have many notable advantages. For example, size and shape can be controlled to minimize clearance, and functionalization with aptamers can drive cell uptake. Also, RNA is a fundamentally biocompatible molecule that is simple, straightforward to produce, and multifunctional. However, its metabolic instability is limiting. Exciting new research has uncovered ‘smart’ RNA structures that are produced by flaviviruses (e.g., Zika, Dengue, West Nile) to thwart nuclease degradation. Compared to other RNA structures used for drug delivery, these nuclease-resistant structures (NRSs) may be uniquely positioned for in vivo applications. The aim of this project is to harness the inherent stability of flaviviral NRSs in the creation of a supramolecular platform for siRNA delivery. This project has the potential to address a critical need in the field of oligonucleotide therapeutics, which has few promising solutions for harnessing the power of RNAi in the clinic. Additionally, this project will validate new stable structures as building blocks for use in RNA nanotechnology and therefore will help researchers design supramolecular structures for a variety of applications well beyond those described in this proposal.";Hill, Alyssa;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.x95x69phd;2021-02-09T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/share/m6-vDbqCBZUjSN8FwMa0gmz3hWNv9_JvYT3511NsUNw;Dryad Digital Repository;Engineering ‘smart’ viral RNA structures for stable and targeted siRNA delivery;84FA4C27-675A-452B-BBF7-D76D0C24711E;190865

Mutations in the SETX gene, which encodes Senataxin, are associated with the progressive neurodegenerative diseases Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia 2 (AOA2) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 4 (ALS4). To identify the causal defect in AOA2, patient-derived cells and SETX knockouts (human and mouse) were analyzed using integrated genomic and transcriptomic approaches. We observed a genome-wide increase in chromosome instability (gains and losses) within genes and at chromosome fragile sites, resulting in changes to gene expression profiles. Senataxin loss caused increased RNA polymerase II pausing events (transcription stress) near promoters that correlated with high GCskew and R-loop accumulation at promoter-proximal regions. Notably, the chromosomal regions with gains and losses overlapped with regions of elevated transcription stress. Aberrant R-loops were resolved by transcription-coupled repair (TCR), in reactions dependent upon the Cockayne Syndrome protein CSB. We found that CSB was required for the recruitment of the TCR endonucleases XPG and XPF, and recombination factors to target and resolve transcription bubbles containing R-loops and promote genomic instability. These results show that cells derived from individuals with Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia 2 exhibit transcription stress giving rise to genome-wide chromosomal fragility, termed transcription stress-induced fragile sites (TSFS), in transcribed regions of the mammalian genome.;Kanagaraj, Radhakrishnan;35042798;2021-04-29T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143574;Gene expression omnibus;" 	Integrated Genome and Transcriptome Analyses Reveal the Mechanism of Genome Instability in Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia 2";CCBFEBA6-5D1D-4656-A465-1C03CE41C25E;142187

High-frequency oscillations in scalp EEG are promising non-invasive biomarkers of epileptogenicity. However, it is unclear how high-frequency oscillations are impacted by age in the pediatric population.We recorded and processed the first 3 hours of sleep EEG data in 30 children and adolescents with focal or generalized epilepsy. We used an automated and clinically validated high-frequency oscillation detector to determine ripple rates (80-250 Hz) in bipolar channels. The software for the detection of HFOs is freely available at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/ZurichNCH/Automatic-High-Frequency-Oscillation-Detector). Furthermore HFO markings are also added in this database for the selected N3 intervals.;"Cserpan, Dori; Georgia, Ramantani; Sarnthein, Johannes";doi:10.18112/openneuro.ds003555;2021-03-05T00:00:00Z;https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003555/;OpenNeuro;Dataset of EEG recordings containing HFO markings for 30 pediatric patients with epilepsy;20121290-60E0-46D3-8359-D2D7B6735D7D;190895

The CrIIIN6 chromophores are particularly appealing for low energy sensitization via energy transfer processes since they show extremely long excited state lifetime reaching millisecond range in the technologically crucial near-infrared domain. However, their properties were barely harnessed in multimetalic structures because of the lack of both monitoring methods and accessible synthetic pathways. We herein report a remedy to monitor and control the formation of CrIII-containing assemblies in solution via the design of a CrIIIN6 inert “complex-as-ligand” that can be included into polymetalic architectures. As a proof of concept, these CrN6 building blocks were reacted in solution with ZnII or FeII to give extended trinuclear linear Cr-M-Cr assemblies, the structure of which could be addressed by NMR spectroscopy despite the presence of two slow relaxing CrIII paramagnetic centers. In addition to long CrIII excited state lifetimes and weak sensitivity to oxygen quenching, these polymetallic assemblies display controlled CrIIIto MII energy transfers, which pave the way for use of the “complex-as-ligand” strategy for introducing photophysically active CrIII probes into light-converting polymetalic devices.;"Doistau, Benjamin; Piguet, Claude";DOI:10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b03163;2020-03-24T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3632899#.XnoeqIhKg2x;Zenodo;A Key Strategy for the Rational Incorporation of Long-lived NIR Emissive Cr(III) Chromophores into Polymetallic Architectures;9CCDC05D-76A4-4121-8029-653317815F7D;183324

Abstract Magnetic Resonance Imaging combined with hyperpolarized 13 C-labelled metabolic contrast agents produced via dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization can, non-invasively and in real-time, report on tissue specific aberrant metabolism. However, hyperpolarization equipment is expensive, technically demanding and needs to be installed on-site for the end-user. In this work, we provide a robust methodology that allows remote production of the hyperpolarized 13 C-labelled metabolic contrast agents. The methodology, built on photo-induced thermally labile radicals, allows solid sample extraction from the hyperpolarization equipment and several hours’ lifetime of the 13 C-labelled metabolic contrast agents at appropriate storage/transport conditions. Exemplified with [U- 13 C, d 7 ]-D-glucose, we remotely produce hyperpolarized 13 C-labelled metabolic contrast agents and generate above 10,000-fold liquid-state Magnetic Resonance signal enhancement at 9.4 T, keeping on-site only a simple dissolution device.;"Ardenkjær-Larsen, Jan Henrik; Capozzi, Andrea; Karlsson, Magnus; Kilund, Jan; Lerche, Mathilde H.; Ouari, Olivier; Patel, Saket; Pinon, Arthur Cesar; Vibert, François";10.1038/s42004-021-00536-9;2021-06-23T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/5083078#.YOgUMegzZaQ;Zenodo;Metabolic contrast agents produced from transported solid 13C-glucose hyperpolarized via dynamic nuclear polarization;617A83AC-6A6E-4C83-B7E8-DAE73FA6D949;190547

Abstract Low-loss photonic integrated circuits and microresonators have enabled a wide range of applications, such as narrow-linewidth lasers and chip-scale frequency combs. To translate these into a widespread technology, attaining ultralow optical losses with established foundry manufacturing is critical. Recent advances in integrated Si 3 N 4 photonics have shown that ultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered microresonators with quality factors Q > 10 × 10 6 can be attained at die-level throughput. Yet, current fabrication techniques do not have sufficiently high yield and performance for existing and emerging applications, such as integrated travelling-wave parametric amplifiers that require meter-long photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate a fabrication technology that meets all requirements on wafer-level yield, performance and length scale. Photonic microresonators with a mean Q factor exceeding 30 × 10 6 , corresponding to 1.0 dB m −1 optical loss, are obtained over full 4-inch wafers, as determined from a statistical analysis of tens of thousands of optical resonances, and confirmed via cavity ringdown with 19 ns photon storage time. The process operates over large areas with high yield, enabling 1-meter-long spiral waveguides with 2.4 dB m −1 loss in dies of only 5 × 5 mm 2 size. Using a response measurement self-calibrated via the Kerr nonlinearity, we reveal that the intrinsic absorption-limited Q factor of our Si 3 N 4 microresonators can exceed 2 × 10 8 . This absorption loss is sufficiently low such that the Kerr nonlinearity dominates the microresonator’s response even in the audio frequency band. Transferring this Si 3 N 4 technology to commercial foundries can significantly improve the performance and capabilities of integrated photonics.;"Engelsen, Nils J.; He, Jijun; Huang, Guanhao; Kippenberg, Tobias J.; Liu, Junqiu; Liu, Tianyi; Raja, Arslan S.; Wang, Rui Ning";10.5281/zenodo.4273990;2021-12-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4273990;ZENODO;High-yield, wafer-scale fabrication of ultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered silicon nitride photonic circuits;655A4DBD-7B45-4090-9BC6-411544EB7BD7;170750

The chiral resolution of a kinetically inert molecular ruby [Cr(dqp)2]3+ (1, dqp =2,6-di(quinolin-8-yl)pyridine) displaying strong dual light emission at room temperature has beenachieved. The wrapped arrangement of the six-membered dqp chelating ligands around the Cr(III)provided nonplanar helical conformations leading to the diastereoselective assembly of chiral bistridentatemonometallic Cr(III)-helix. The PP-(+)-[Cr(dqp)2]3+ and MM-(−)-[Cr(dqp)2]3+enantiomers could be separated and isolated by using cation-exchange chromatography andsubsequent salt-metathesis with KPF6. X-ray crystallographic analysis based on Flack parametersassigned the absolute configurations of the two enantiomers. Circularly polarized luminescence(CPL) spectra showed two polarized emission bands within the NIR region corresponding to thecharacteristic metal-centered spin-flip Cr(2E → 4A2) and Cr(2T1 → 4A2) transitions withexceptionally high dissymmetry factors, |glum|, of 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, which are comparable tothose reported for rare-earth chiral complexes. Photophysical properties also revealed an extremelylong excited-state lifetime of 1.2 ms and a high quantum yield of 5.2% at room temperature in water.These properties make [Cr(dqp)2]3+ an ideal sensitizer for the preparation of enantiopure luminescent supramolecular energyconverting devices and also open up the possibility of using chiral Cr(III) chromophores for the construction of NIR-CPL materials and polarized photonic devices based on earth-abundant metals.;"Jimenez, Juan-Ramon; Piguet, Claude";doi:10.1021/jacs.9b06524;2019-03-24T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3375198#.XnofgohKg2x;Zenodo;Chiral Molecular Ruby [Cr(dqp)2]3+ with Long-Lived Circularly Polarized Luminescence;230BC619-65FB-4885-A960-4ED757D55938;183324

Our social world has been transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond the direct impact of the pandemic on physical health, the social distancing measures implemented worldwide to slow down disease transmission have dramatically impacted social interactions1,2. These measures, including orders to stay at home and to maintain a social distance of at least 2 meters, have been essential to limit the spread of the disease, but they have had severe costs for humans as social animals2. Right before and right after the adoption of the most stringent measures in Switzerland in Spring 2020, we were conducting a series of experiments to measure the representation of the so-called peripersonal space - the space immediately surrounding our body, where we normally interact with objects and other individuals3. We found that the introduction of social distancing measures led to a reduction in the extent of the peripersonal space and enhanced its segregation between individuals, as if the presence of others in close space would activate an implicit form of freezing response.;Serino, Silvia;10.17605/OSF.IO/F7539;;https://osf.io/f7539/;Open Science Framework;Sharpening of peripersonal space during the COVID-19 pandemic;F4255610-E158-4258-B354-7CC90CA3D4F2;190883

Directed, intentional imagination is pivotal for creativity, self-regulation in the form of escapism, and therapies for mental disorders. The latter in particular benefits from increasing our understanding of directed imagination, as well as non-invasive means of influencing imagined content as well as its vividness. To investigate directed imagination, this study draws from the prior observation that music can influence the imagined content during mind-wandering, as well as the finding that relative orientation within time and space is retained in imagination. One hundred participants engaged in a directed imagination task, that required watching a visual inducer in which a figure travels towards a barely visible landmark in the far distance, and then closing their eyes and imagine a continuation of the journey. During each imagined journey, participants either listened to auditory inducers in form of music, or to a silent control condition. After the imagined journeys, participants provided responses about vividness, the imagined time passed and distance travelled, as well as detailed descriptions of the imagined content. Bayesian mixed effects models reveal strong evidence that vividness, sentiment, as well imagined time passed and distances travelled, are systematically influenced based on the auditory inducers, and further show that aspects of these effects can be modelled through features - such as tempo - of the auditory inducer. The results highlight music’s potential to support therapies such as Exposure Therapy and Imagery Rescripting, which deploy directed imagination as a clinical tool for the treatment of mental disorders.;Herff, Steffen A.;https://osf.io/g6snp/;2021-04-19T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/g6snp/;Open Science Framework;Wanderful Music: The effect of music on vividness and content of imagined journeys;94EC1A03-F146-41A8-B3B7-8AD5F44730FC;196567

We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that virtual sound sources in audio augmented environments are particularly suitable for triggering and directing imaginations within human inner perception. Our hypothesis was that the binaural listening to imaginary entities at the place of recording (so to speak 'in-situ') enhances the imagination in a special way, since sound as a non-visual medium favours the creation of images in human inner perception. We narrowed down our research question especially in regards to our practical experimentations to possible applications in areas that rely on the guided creation of individual or intersubjective imaginations, such as urban planning and scenario development, certain forms of trauma therapy, as well as audiovisual art and fiction.;"Rumori, Martin; Zeller, Ludwig";10.5281/zenodo.5653527;2021-11-08T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/5653527;Zenodo;"SNSF Spark project ""Sonic Imagination"" – Excerpts of recorded evaluation interviews";1CA21E6E-DC40-4366-AC1E-AC7E821DCE80;195868

These data were produced from field campaigns in Colombia conducted by R. Scott Winton, Edmundo Mendoza and many other local helpers in collaboration with Fundación Horizonte Verde from September 2020 to August 2021. The data set includes information about the presence of peat, peat depth (if any), ecological community type, surface water depth, surface water pH, surface water specific conductivity, canopy height, canopy density and underlying mineral soil description. Two types of surveys were conducted: complete and rapid. In complete surveys, all information was collected as well as extraction of complete peat profiles and 0.1 ha vegetation plots. In rapid surveys, only peat presence, ecosystem type, peat depth and canopy height were taken. Collected soil samples are still being processed and analyzed as of publication of this data set. Associated publications are forthcoming. The work was funded by an Swiss National Science Foundation Spark grant (CRSK-2_190328).;Winton, Robert Scott;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000520816;2021-12-15T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000520816;ETH Research Collection;Peatlands of eastern Colombia;DE0A4BC4-10D4-45D0-8910-4FC568C2BAE9;190328

Light absorbing organic atmospheric particles, termed brown carbon, undergo chemical and photochemical aging processes during their lifetime in the atmosphere. The role these particles play in the global radiative balance and in the climate system is still uncertain. To better quantify their radiative forcing due to aerosol-radiation interactions, we need to improve process level understanding of aging processes, which lead to either ‘browning’ or ‘bleaching’ of organic aerosols. Currently available laboratory techniques aim to simulate atmospheric aerosol aging and measure the evolving light absorption, but suffer from low sensitivity and precision. This study describes the use of electrodynamic balance photophoretic spectroscopy (EDB-PPS) for high sensitivity and high precision measurements of light absorption by a single particle. We demonstrate the retrieval of time-evolving imaginary part of the refractive index for a single levitated particle in the range of 10-4 to 10-5 with uncertainties of less than 25% and 60%, respectively. The experimental system is housed within an environmental chamber, in which aging processes can be simulated in realistic atmospheric conditions and lifetime of days to weeks. This high level of sensitivity enables future studies to explore the major processes responsible for formation and degradation of brown carbon aerosols.;"Bluvshtein, Nir; Krieger, Ulrich; Peter, Thomas";10.3929/ethz-b-000419840;;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/419840;ETH Zuerich Research Collection;Photophoretic spectroscopy in atmospheric chemistry – high-sensitivity measurements of light absorption by a single particle;8EFEE96F-D8A5-4EFA-8F43-9D225D98270E;190477

This atlas is an ensemble of pollen-presence digital maps for Europe including 194 taxa from the Eurasian Modern Pollen Database (EMPD v2). The pollen presence is estimated using Kriging over a regular 25-km grid and freely shared as multivariate ESRI GeoTIFF file for every taxa together with the related point dataset as ESRI Shapefile.  The GeoTIFF maps contain the probabilistic pollen-presence estimation, a discrete map of the pollen presence, and an uncertainty map derived from the Kriging variance.This dataset is released with the following publication:Oriani F., Mariethoz G., Chevalier M., EUPollMap: The European atlas of contemporary pollen distribution maps derived from an integrated Kriging interpolation approach, submitted to Earth System Science Data.;Oriani, Fabio;10.5281/zenodo.7259017;2022-10-28T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/7259017;Zenodo;EUPollMap;622D4EBE-9F18-4380-BCF7-0CA1AB2D8745;195875
Prime editing is a highly versatile CRISPR-based genome editing technology that works without DNA double-strand break formation. Despite rapid technological advances, in vivo application for the treatment of genetic diseases remains challenging. Here, we developed a size-reduced SpCas9 prime editor (PE) lacking the RNaseH domain (PE2ΔRnH) and an intein-split construct (PE2 p.1153) for adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery into the liver. Editing efficiencies reached 15% at the Dnmt1 locus and were further elevated to 58% by delivering unsplit PE2ΔRnH via human adenoviral vector 5 (AdV). To provide proof of concept for correcting a genetic liver disease, we used the AdV approach for repairing the disease-causing Pahenu2 mutation in a mouse model of phenylketonuria (PKU) via prime editing. Average correction efficiencies of 11.1% (up to 17.4%) in neonates led to therapeutic reduction of blood phenylalanine, without inducing detectable off-target mutations or prolonged liver inflammation. Although the current in vivo prime editing approach for PKU has limitations for clinical application due to the requirement of high vector doses (7 × 1014 vg/kg) and the induction of immune responses to the vector and the PE, further development of the technology may lead to curative therapies for PKU and other genetic liver diseases.;Böck, Desiree;10.1126/scitranslmed.abl9238;2022-03-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE174757;Gene Expression Omnibus Database (GEO);Treatment of a metabolic liver disease by in vivo prime editing in mice;B846F0E6-FAC1-45A7-8139-7C2F6472AF90;196287

The Diffusion-Simulated Connectivity Dataset is generated from a numerical phantom and Monte-Carlo simulation of the diffusion-weighted MRI signal [Rafael-Patino et al., Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 2020]. The dataset was created to evaluate diffusion-weighted MRI-based structural connectome estimation techniques such as voxel-wise fibre orientation estimation, tractography, and structural connectome estimation. The phantom is constructed from 12,196 synthetic tubular fibres (strands) ranging in diameter from 1.4μm to 4.2μm. The phantom geometry was obtained using the optimisation procedure included in the Numerical Fiber Generator [Close et al., NeuroImage, 2009]. Sixteen regions of interest (ROIs) located on the surface of a sphere are connected through a variable number of strands. The strands form complex white matter configurations that include kissing, branching, and crossing at different angles. The weights of the 16x16 ground truth connectivity matrix are defined by the total cross-sectional area of the strands forming the connections.;"Caruyer, Emmanuel; Girard, Gabriel; Pizzolato, Marco; Rafael-Patino, Jonathan; Thiran, Jean-Philippe; Truffet, Raphael";DOI: 10.17632/fgf86jdfg6.1;2021-04-08T00:00:00Z;https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fgf86jdfg6/1;Mendeley;The Diffusion-Simulated Connectivity Dataset;48D6D8A7-B10D-47F2-A2A1-F2F6A1266DC1;190297

Virtually inert sulfur hexafluoride becomes a precious pentafluorosulfanylation agent, if properly activated by photoredox catalysis, to access α-fluoro and α-alkoxy SF5-compounds. This advanced protocol converts SF6 in the presence of alkynols as bifunctional C−C- and C−O-bond forming reagents directly into pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen-containing heterocycles in a single step from α-substituted alkenes. The proposed mechanism is supported by theoretical calculations and gives insights not only in the pentafluorosulfanylation step but also into formation of the carbon-carbon bond and is in full agreement with Baldwin's cyclization rules. The key step is a radical type 5-, 6- respectively 7-exo-dig-cyclization. The synthesized oxaheterocycles cannot be simply prepared by other synthetic methods, show a high level of structural complexity and significantly expand the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks valuable for medicinal and material chemistry.;"Birenheide, Bernhard; Rombach, David; Wagenknecht, Hans‐Achim";https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000489263;2021-04-08T00:00:00Z;https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fchem.202100767&file=chem202100767-sup-0001-misc_information.pdf;Wiley;Photoredox Catalytic Pentafluorosulfanylative Domino Cyclization of α‐Substituted Alkenes to Oxaheterocycles by Using SF 6;2FFB73B3-510C-4D6B-AE65-B56CEE9792AA;195863

We report a mild and operationally simple trifluoroacylation strategy of olefines, that utilizes trifluoroacetic anhydride as a low-cost and readily available reagent. This light-mediated process is fundamentally different from conventional methodologies and occurs through a trifluoroacyl radical mechanism promoted by a photocatalyst, which triggers a C-O bond fragmentation. Mechanistic studies (kinetic isotope effects, spectroelectrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, theoretical investigations) highlight the evidence of a fleeting CF3CO radical under photoredox conditions. The trifluoroacyl radical can be stabilized under CO atmosphere, delivering the trifluoroacetylation product with higher chemical efficiency. Furthermore, the method can be turned into a trifluoromethylation protocol by simply changing the reaction parameters. Beyond simple alkenes, this method allows for chemo- and regioselective functionalization of small-molecule drugs and common pharmacophores;"Jeschke, Gunnar; Katayev, Dmitry; Nötel, Nicolas Yannick; Rombach, David; Zhang, Kun";https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000505548;2021-10-04T00:00:00Z;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fanie.202109235&file=anie202109235-sup-0001-misc_information.pdf;Wiley;Radical Trifluoroacetylation of Alkenes Triggered by a Visible‐Light‐Promoted C–O Bond Fragmentation of Trifluoroacetic Anhydride;C9CB29CE-ED71-45E1-B95C-439984D6738C;195863

The distinct activities of organelles depend on the proper function of their membranes. Coordinated membrane biogenesis of different organelles necessitates lipid transport from their site of synthesis to their destination. Several factors have been proposed to participate in lipid distribution, but despite its basic importance, in vivo evidence linking the absence of putative transport pathways to specific transport defects remains scarce. A reason for this scarcity is the near absence of in vivo lipid trafficking assays. Here we introduce a versatile method named METALIC (Mass tagging-Enabled TrAcking of Lipids In Cells) to track interorganelle lipid flux inside cells. In this strategy, two enzymes, one directed to a ‘donor’ and the other to an ‘acceptor’ organelle, add two distinct mass tags to lipids. Mass-spectrometry-based detection of lipids bearing the two mass tags is then used to quantify exchange between the two organelles. By applying this approach, we show that the ERMES and Vps13-Mcp1 complexes have transport activity in vivo, and unravel their relative contributions to endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria lipid exchange.;"John Peter, Arun T.; Kornmann, Benoît; Peter, Matthias; Petrungaro, Carmelina";10.1038/s41556-022-00917-9;2022-06-02T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS3415/metabolites;Metabolights;Interorganelle lipid flux revealed by enzymatic mass tagging in vivo;D5CAF36D-718B-4D55-BD3E-0BACBFB52B6A;190364

The dataset is obtained from the Signal Identification Guide (SIGID) wiki, an organized database of information on radio signals. It contains audio samples (.wav, .mp3, .ogg), spectrogram images (.png) and metadata on radio signals in two .csv files. Each signal is characterized by signal type, frequency, bandwidth, modulation type, location, sample audio, spectrogram and a short description. They were received and recorded using software defined radio, and most of the audio samples have been demodulated from IQ energy information to audio. The dataset is created by crawling the SIGID wiki website to gather the data on known and unknown signals, updated last time in February 2021.We include two python scripts that can be used to produce audio chunks and corresponding spectrograms, which were used to train the self-organizing map models in the research projects.;"Martins, Yann Patrick; Savic, Selena";10.5281/zenodo.4673430;2021-04-11T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/4673430;Zenodo;Radio Explorations Data;939DCAEE-9AE0-4552-86CA-0B8C51B6467E;190310

Current systems for gaze estimation are usually trained and evaluated on datasets with relatively ideal near frontal head poses and visual targets in front of the user. While this make it useful for model design and method comparison, their performance in other realistic sensing conditions and setups is relatively unknown. Developing datasets for such situations is thus needed, both to evaluate robustness of above methods, measure their performance, understand their limitations, and trigger new research to push further the state of the art of gaze tracking.The ManiGaze dataset was designed with these goals in mind. More specifically, it was created to evaluate gaze estimation from remote RGB and RGB-D (standard vision and depth) sensors in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) settings, and more specifically during object manipulation tasks. The recording methodology was designed to let the user behave freely and encourage a natural interaction with the robot, as well as to automatically collect gaze targets, since a-posteriori annotation is almost impossible for gaze. The dataset involves 17 person who performed four different tasks in four sessions:- Marker on the table Targets (MT) session. The robot asks the user to look or point at markers located on a table placed between the robot and himself.- End-effector Targets (ET) session. The robot asks the user to look at its end-effector as it moves them in the space between them.- Object Manipulation (OM) session. The robot asks the user to perform a sequence of pick-and-place actions using different objects.- Set the Table (ST) session. The user is asked to show and explain to the robot how to set a table, with plate, knife and fork, spoon, and glass.The gaze ground truth was automatically recorded for the first two session, providing a convenient benchmark to evaluate gaze estimation methods. The two last sessions provide additional material for further research (e.g. eye-hand coordination, movement analysis, ...).;"Odobez, Jean-Marc; Siegfried, Rémy";https://doi.org/10.34777/wmy9-3653;2020-08-10T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.34777/wmy9-3653;Zenodo;ManiGaze;282E8AC3-9EAC-4710-A9E8-1E9B2BBE8E27;172627
Abstract The nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) is recurrently mutated in human cancers including acute leukemia. We show that NSD1 knockdown alters erythroid clonogenic growth of human CD34 + hematopoietic cells. Ablation of Nsd1 in the hematopoietic system of mice induces a transplantable erythroleukemia. In vitro differentiation of Nsd1−/− erythroblasts is majorly impaired despite abundant expression of GATA1, the transcriptional master regulator of erythropoiesis, and associated with an impaired activation of GATA1-induced targets. Retroviral expression of wildtype NSD1, but not a catalytically-inactive NSD1 N1918Q SET-domain mutant induces terminal maturation of Nsd1−/− erythroblasts. Despite similar GATA1 protein levels, exogenous NSD1 but not NSD N1918Q significantly increases the occupancy of GATA1 at target genes and their expression. Notably, exogenous NSD1 reduces the association of GATA1 with the co-repressor SKI, and knockdown of SKI induces differentiation of Nsd1−/− erythroblasts. Collectively, we identify the NSD1 methyltransferase as a regulator of GATA1-controlled erythroid differentiation and leukemogenesis.;"Almosailleakh, Marwa; Bagger, Frederik Otzen; Bezerra, Matheus F.; Bock, Thomas; Ivanek, Robert; Juge, Sabine; Leonards, Katharina; Losson, Régine; Mercher, Thomas; Méreau, Hélène; Peters, Antoine H.

FLUXNET-CH4 is an initiative led by the Global Carbon Project, in close partnership with AmeriFlux and EuroFlux, to compile a global database of eddy covariance (EC) methane flux measurements. Data are standardized, post-processed (i.e., partitioned and gap-filled), and released as FLUXNET-CH4 (Delwiche et al. 2021, Knox et al. 2019). FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 includes data from 81 sites, representing freshwater, coastal, upland, natural, and managed ecosystems. The near continuous, high-frequency nature of EC measurements offers significant promise for improving our understanding of ecosystem-scale CH4 flux dynamics. FLUXNET-CH4 exists thanks to the hard work of the site teams who collected these data and their willingness to participate in the FLUXNET-CH4 effort. Please refer to the Data Policy page for data usage and acknowledgement requirements. Funding for the FLUXNET-CH4 initiative was provided by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the USGS Powell Center.;FLUXNET,;https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2020-307;2021-01-01T00:00:00Z;https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/;FLUXNET;FLUXNET-CH4 Community Product;47CE56A1-0019-4AC9-9EA4-0B8B013A9805;173691
"The NFIA-ETO2 fusion is the product of a t(1;16)(p31;q24) chromosomal translocation so far exclusively found in pediatric patients with pure erythroid leukemia (PEL). To address the role for the pathogenesis of the disease, we expressed the NFIA-ETO2 fusion in murine erythroblasts. We observed that NFIA-ETO2 significantly increased proliferation and impaired erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleuemia (MEL) cells and of primary fetal liver-derived erythroblasts. However, NFIA-ETO2-expressing erythroblasts acquired neither aberrant in vitro clonogenic activity nor disease-inducing potential upon transplantation into irradiated syngenic mice. In contrast, in the presence of one of the most prevalent erythroleukemia-associated mutations, TP53R248Q, expression of NFIA-ETO2 resulted in aberrant clonogenic activity, and induced a fully penetrant transplantable PEL-like disease in mice. Molecular studies support that NFIA-ETO2 interferes with erythroid differentiation by preferentially binding and repressing erythroid genes that contain NFI binding sites and/or are decorated by ETO2, resulting in a activity shift from GATA- to ETS-motif-containing target genes. In contrast, TP53R248Q does not affect erythroid differentiation but provides self-renewal and survival potential, mostly via downregulation of known TP53 targets. Collectively, our work indicates that NFIA-ETO2 initiates PEL by suppressing gene expression programs of terminal erythroid differentiation and cooperates with TP53 mutation to induce erythroleukemia.";"Bezerra, Matheus Filgueira; Cantillo, Oriano Valerio; Fagnan, Alexandre; Ivanek, Robert; Jevtic, Zivojin; Juge, Sabine; Louwaige, Amber; Mercher, Thomas; Moll, Ute; Nellas, Ioannis; Otzen Bagger, Frederik; Piqué-Borràs, Maria-Riera; Schultz-Heddergott, Ramona; Schwaller, Juerg; Seguin, Jonathan; Sivalingam, Rathick; Tzankov, Alexandar";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE205437;2023-02-03T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE205437;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/;The NFIA-ETO2 fusion blocks erythroid maturation and induces pure erythroid leukemia in cooperation with mutant TP53;1B551787-81E5-47F1-BBAE-C9CBB73BA0C9;173224

"AbstractAssociating with relatives in social groups can bring benefits such as reduced risk of aggression and increased likelihood of cooperation. Competition among relatives over limited resources, on the other hand, can induce individuals to alter their patterns of association. Population density might further affect the costs and benefits of associating with relatives by altering resource competition or by changing the structure of social groups; preventing easy association with relatives. Consequently, the overlap between genetic and social structure is expected to decrease with increasing population size, as well as during times of increased breeding activity. Here, we use multi-layer network techniques to quantify the similarity between long-term, high resolution genetic, and behavioral data from a large population of free-ranging house mice (Mus musculus domesticus), studied over 10 years. We infer how the benefit of associating with genetically similar individuals might fluctuate in relation to breeding behavior and environmental conditions. We found a clear seasonal effect, with decreased overlap between social and genetic structure during summer months, characterized by high temperatures and high breeding activity. Though the effect of overall population size was relatively weak, we found a clear decrease in the overlap between genetic similarity and social associations within larger groups. As well as longer-term within-group changes, these results reveal population-wide short-term shifts in how individuals associate with relatives. Our study suggests that resource competition modifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of interacting with relatives.";"Evans, Julian C; König, Barbara; Lindholm, Anna K";doi;2020-06-18T00:00:00Z;https://academic.oup.com/cz;doi;Long-term overlap of social and genetic structure in free-ranging house mice reveals dynamic seasonal and group size effects;857E979B-103E-4639-B95E-FB410CDA2BA9;176114

Myelination calls for a tremendous surge in cell metabolism towards lipids and membrane production. However, functional relevance of de novo fatty acid synthesis in myelinating cells remains unclear. We generated mutant mice in which the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) was depleted conditionally in Schwann cells, the myelinating glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. To address how lack of FASN was affecting the development of the peripheral nervous system, we screened with an Affymetrix Transcriptomic approach the transcriptome of sciatic nerves and roots of P60 FASN mutant mice, comparing to control mice.;"Montani, Laura; Suter, Ueli";GSE71373;2018-02-02T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71373;GEO;Transcriptomic analysis of the peripheral nervous system of Schwann cell-conditional FASN knockout mice;2C940EB2-EEDB-43F2-9C64-7345BBF167FA;173078

Adult male mice underwent injection with retrograde neuronal tracer cholera toxin subunit β conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555  in the nucleus accumbens. After recovery, mice underwent chronic social stress (CSS) or control handling (CON). One day later, brains were collected. Coronal sections inluding the basal amygdala were prepared. Laser capture microdissection was used to identify and collect CTB-555+ neuronal cell bodies in the BA (i.e. BA-NAc neurons). 500 such tissue samples were collected per mouse, lysis was conducted, and lysates pooled. RNA was isolated, followed by cDNA synthesis and library preparation. Low-input RNA sequencing was conducted on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina).

A pronounced late Miocene cooling (LMC) from 7 to 5.7 Ma has been documented in extratropical and tropical sea surface temperature records, but to date, available proxy evidence has not revealed a significant pCO2 decline over this event. Here, we provide a new, high resolution pCO2 proxy record over the late Miocene cooling based on alkenone carbon isotopic fractionation (εp) measured in sediments from the South Atlantic at ODP Site 1088. We apply a recent proxy calibration derived from a compilation of laboratory cultures, which more accurately reflects the proxy sensitivity to pCO2 changes during late Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles, together with new micropaleontological proxies to reconstruct past variations in algal growth rate, an important secondary influence on the εp. Our resulting pCO2 record suggests a 2-3 fold decline over the late Miocene Cooling and confirms a strong coupling between climate and pCO2 through the late Miocene. Within this long-term trend are pCO2 variations on sub-myr timescales that may reflect 400kyr long-eccentricity cycles, in which pCO2 minima coincide with several orbital scale maxima in published high-resolution benthic 18O records. These may correspond to ephemeral glaciations, potentially in the Northern Hemisphere. Our temperature and planktonic 18O records from Site 1088 are consistent with substantial equatorward movement of Southern Ocean frontal systems during the LMC. This suggests that potential feedbacks between cooling, ocean circulation and deep ocean CO2 storage may warrant further investigation during the LMC.;Tanner, Thomas;"https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.924529 ";2020-04-20T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.924529;Pangaea;New Tie points, organic and inorganic data, growth rate and pCO2 reconstructions for the late Miocene Cooling of ODP Hole 177-1088B;733A6D03-B7B2-4536-AEDF-FF96BDDA8810;182070

The metal ion transporter ZIP8 (SLC39A8) mediates cellular uptake of vital divalent metal ions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant A391T (rs13107325) is associated with numerous human traits, including reduced arterial blood pressure, increased body mass index and hyperlipidemia. We analyzed in vitro the transport properties of mutant ZIP8 A391T and investigated in vivo in mice the physiological effects of this polymorphism. In vitro , the intrinsic transport properties of mutant ZIP8 were similar to those of wild type ZIP8, but cellular uptake of zinc, cadmium and iron was attenuated due to reduced ZIP8 plasma membrane expression. We then generated the ZIP8 A393T mice (ZIP8KI) that carry the corresponding polymorphism and characterized their phenotype. We observed lower protein expression in lung and kidney membrane extracts in ZIP8KI mice. The ZIP8KI mice exhibited striking changes in metal ion composition of the tissues, including cobalt, palladium, mercury and platinum. In agreement with GWAS, ZIP8KI mice showed reduced arterial blood pressure. Body weight and plasma lipid composition remained unchanged, although these features were reported to be increased in GWAS. ZIP8KI mice also exhibited remarkable insulin resistance and were protected from elevated blood glucose when challenged by dietary sucrose supplementation. We showed that increased hepatic insulin receptor expression and decreased ZnT8 (slc30a8) metal ion transporter mRNA expression are associated with this phenotypic change. In conclusion, our data reveal that ZIP8 plays an important role in blood pressure regulation and glucose homeostasis.;"Bermudez-Lekerika, Paola; Bhardwaj, Rajesh; Escher, Geneviève; Fuster, Daniel G.; Hediger, Matthias A.; Hofstetter, Willy; Lenglet, Sébastien; Pujol-Giménez, Jonai; Scherler, Laeticia; Siegrist, Mark; Thomas, Aurélien; Verouti, Sophia N.; Vogt, Bruno";doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2022.912277;2022-06-15T00:00:00Z;https://figshare.com/s/d662a262dda51f034b2a;figshare;The Allelic Variant A391T of Metal Ion Transporter ZIP8 (SLC39A8) Leads to Hypotension and Enhanced Insulin Resistance;D06CB0FD-23BD-4AD3-8CE6-C65293F3B0EF;182272

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Echinococcus multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a rising zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere. Treatment of this fatal disease is limited to chemotherapy using benzimidazoles and surgical intervention, with frequent disease recurrence in cases without radical surgery. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying E. multilocularis infections and host-parasite interactions ultimately aids developing novel therapeutic options. This study explored an involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS) during E. multilocularis infection in mice.E. multilocularis- and mock-infected C57BL/6 mice were subdivided into vehicle, albendazole (ABZ) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (αPD-L1) treated groups. To mimic a chronic infection, treatments of mice started six weeks post i.p. infection and continued for another eight weeks. Liver tissue was then collected to examine inflammatory cytokines and the expression of UPR- and ERS-related genes.E. multilocularis infection led to an upregulation of UPR- and ERS-related proteins in the liver, including ATF6, CHOP, GRP78, ERp72, H6PD and calreticulin, whilst PERK and its target eIF2α were not affected, and IRE1α and ATF4 were downregulated. ABZ treatment in E. multilocularis infected mice reversed, or at least tended to reverse, these protein expression changes to levels seen in mock-infected mice. Furthermore, ABZ treatment reversed the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ in the liver of infected mice. Similar to ABZ, αPD-L1 immune-treatment tended to reverse the increased CHOP and decreased ATF4 and IRE1α expression levels.AE caused chronic inflammation, UPR activation and ERS in mice. The E. multilocularis-induced inflammation and consecutive ERS was ameliorated by ABZ and αPD-L1 treatment, indicating their effectiveness to inhibit parasite proliferation and downregulate its activity status. Neither ABZ nor αPD-L1 themselves affected UPR in control mice. Further research is needed to elucidate the link between inflammation, UPR and ERS, and if these pathways offer potential for improved therapies of patients with AE.;"Beldi, Guido; Gottstein, Bruno; Jebbawi, Fadi; Lundström-Stadelmann, Britta; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon; Wang, Junhua; Weingartner, Michael";10.5281/zenodo.5837948;2022-03-03T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5837948;zenodo;Data_Figure1_Albendazole reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by Echinococcus multilocularis in mice;53F70A5A-1CAA-404A-B70C-CDE21986FB28;179400

Bile acids control lipid homeostasis by regulating uptake from food and excretion. Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity. In conclusion, the established LC-MS/MS method enables uncomplicated sample preparation and quantification of key bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue of human and rodent species to facilitate future studies of disease mechanisms and drug-induced liver injury.;"Bouitbir, Jamal; Gómez, Cristina; Kratschmar, Denise V; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon";10.5281/zenodo.4529044;2020-07-09T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4529044;Zenodo;Data_Tab1_Development and Validation of a Highly Sensitive LC-MS/MS Method for the Analysis of Bile Acids in Serum, Plasma, and Liver Tissue Samples;0A3B0BA2-D0E2-496C-A3EF-C3F3B01302E4;179400

Ice Nucleating Particles (INP) are a subclass of atmospheric aerosol particles, which can force heterogeneous freezing of cloud droplets at temperatures above -38 degrees C. In contrast, ice particles form from cloud droplets at temperatures below -38 degrees C due to homogeneous freezing, without INP. Due to their abundance, these particles can affect micro-physical properties of clouds, while acting as INP. During the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) cruise around the Southern Ocean, off-line filter sampling was performed. Filters were stored on the ship and analysed after the cruise at Leibniz-Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS) concerning INP abundance. We give INP number concentrations for sampling periods of 8 hours (or 2 hours in special cases) each.;"Baccarini, Andrea; Hartmann, Markus; Henning, Silvia; Lehtipalo, Katrianne; Schmale, Julia; Tatzelt, Christian; Tummon, Fiona; Welti, André";10.5281/zenodo.2636777;2019-07-02T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/2636777#.XvWYOdXKFhE;Zenodo;Ice Nucleating Particle number concentration over the Southern Ocean during the austral summer of 2016/2017 on board the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE).;91B4F084-46ED-48DC-B5D1-8CF27A71D568;169090
The authors would highly appreciate to be contacted if the data is used for any purpose.We measured coarse mode aerosol particle size distributions with an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS, model TSI 3321) at a time resolution of five minutes during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). The diameter range is 0.7 to 19 µm. Particles in this size range are indicative of primary sea spray aerosol, biological particles and potentially long-range transported mineral dust. These particles are also important for cloud formation as they act as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nucleating particles, the latter especially in the case of biological particles and mineral dust.Typically the instrument reports data starting from particles with a diameter greater than 500 nm, however, particle number concentrations in the channels below 723 nm were overestimated, which is a common artefact with this instrument.The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel. Temporal coverage is from December 20, 2016 to April 10, 2017. We give five-minute averaged data as dN/dlog(dp), where dN is the particle number concentration per measured size bin normalized over the logarithm of the bin width. The bin width is defined as the distance between two diameters. They are spaced equally in log-space with dlog(dp) = log(d_n+1/d_n) = 1/32. To derive the total particle number concentration one has to integrate over the diameter range taking into account the normalization by dlog(dp).;"Baccarini, Andrea; Gysel-Beer, Martin; Hartmann, Markus; Henning, Silvia; Landwehr, Sebastian; Lehtipalo, Katrianne; Schmale, Julia; Tatzelt, Christian; Tummon, Fiona; Welti, André";10.5281/zenodo.2636709;2019-06-19T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/2636709#.XvWaGdXKFhE;Zenodo;Coarse mode aerosol particle size distribution collected in the Southern Ocean in the austral summer of 2016/2017, during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition.;EEBE4744-51EC-4841-89EB-9355C9F5E8B1;169090

The metabolic fingerprint of in vitro grown E. multilocularis metacestodes was determined. E. multilocularis metacestodes were grown in rat hepatoma-cell pre-conditioned culture medium (cDMEM) for 72 hours at 37°C. After this incubation period, parasite-interacted media (vcDMEM, n=10) and control incubated media (ccDMEM, n=10) were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR: 1D 1H, 2D 1H-1H, and 2D 1H-13C Bruker DRX 600MHz). In addition, also vesicle fluid (VF, n=5) samples from metacestodes were analyzed after 72 hours of incubation by NMR accordingly.;"Li, Jia; Lundström-Stadelmann, Britta; Ritler, Dominic; Rufener, Reto";11304/0e960524-02dc-4bbb-ab26-792483388986;2019-07-28T00:00:00Z;https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/cf3ac1ee15a743df99f044befea73f68;https://www.eudat.eu/;NMR spectra of media and vesicle fluid of in vitro grown Echinococcus multilocularis metacestodes;03C8CDEC-FE59-4597-9A23-A256992E48EC;179439

"Data and R Code for the paper ""Making New Year's Resolutions that Stick: Exploring how Superordinate and Subordinate Goals Motivate Goal Pursuit"".BackgroundNew Year's Eve is a time when people make resolutions, but, more often than not, fail to achieve them. Previous research highlighted the positive effect of subordinate goals in goal pursuit. We argue that combining superordinate and subordinate goals contributes to successful goal pursuit, especially in the long run. We test whether a simultaneous focus on both goal types helps people to keep their resolutions.MethodsUsing a 2 × 2 between‐subjects design, participants (N = 256) formulated a resolution from which they derived either a superordinate (yes/no) or a subordinate goal (yes/no). The control group focused exclusively on a self‐set resolution. Main outcome measures were effort in goal pursuit and intentions to further pursue the goal after 3 months.ResultsFocusing on superordinate and subordinate goals increased the amount of effort invested in goal pursuit. A group difference was found only between the group focusing on both goal types and the group focusing on a superordinate goal. No statement could be made about intentions for further goal pursuit and processes by which goal type affects goal pursuit.ConclusionThe study provides preliminary insights into how combining superordinate and subordinate goals may be a helpful strategy to pursue long‐term goals.";Höchli, Bettina;10.17605/OSF.IO/VRWZP;2019-06-24T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/vrwzp/?view_only=fb0c5b5552fe43a382fbec5f987daff1;Open Science Framework;Making New Year’s Resolutions that Stick;2E36FF91-AC3C-42B2-848E-A548C1895EE1;159379

A functional trait approach helps to evaluate the consequences of land use on community assembly and consequently ecosystem functions. Morphometric traits of insects, which are related to functions such as microhabitat use or dispersal, overcome some of the caveats of literature-based traits.;"Blüthgen, Nico; Gossner, Martin; Neff, Felix; Simons, Nadja; Weisser, Wolfgang";BExIS ID 24266;2019-06-06T00:00:00Z;https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/ddm/data/Showdata/24266;BExIS;"Morphometric Traits of Herbivorous Insects (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera; Orthoptera)";ECB299E5-7C8E-44FB-8AC3-4AF600EFB450;173542
Leaf traits, which are affected by environmental drivers such as land-use intensity, influence ecosystem processes such as biomass production and herbivory. Land-use drivers such as fertilization in grasslands are expected to affect leaf traits not only by changing the plant community composition, but also by affecting leaf traits within species, resulting in intraspecific variability in leaf traits along land-use intensity gradients.We assessed three leaf measures (area, fresh weight, dry weight) on the most abundant plant species based on vegetation surveys in the previous years on all forest and grassland plots in all three regions in 2017/2018. Area was measured on single leaves using a leaf area meter, fresh and dry weight were measured for sets of 3-20 leaves.;"Gossner, Martin; Neff, Felix; Prati, Daniel";BExIS ID 24807;2019-03-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/ddm/data/Showdata/24807;BExIS;Leaf traits of most abundant plant species from all EPs, 2017/2018;15D8C39B-53FC-4AE2-BEA4-21785C84AFEC;173542

This project contains short-read sequencing data from 100 species of cichlid from Lake Victoria and the nearby Kyoga Basin that together comprise the full range of extant ecological diversity for this classic example of adaptive radiation.;McGee, Matt;PRJNA626405 ID: 626405;2020-04-19T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA626405;NCBI;Haplochromine cichlids: Lake Victoria cichlid ecological diversity;7CC49BB3-FA43-4D7E-81EA-16ED56DC9BC1;163338
The East African cichlid radiations are characterised by repeated and rapid diversification into many distinct species with different ecological specialisations and by a history of hybridization events between non-sister species. Such hybridization might provide important fuel for adaptive radiation. Interspecific hybrids can have extreme trait values or novel trait combinations and such transgressive phenotypes may allow some hybrids to explore ecological niches neither of the parental species could tap into. Here, we investigate the potential of second-generation (F2) hybrids between two generalist cichlid species from Lake Malawi to exploit a resource neither parental species is specialised on: feeding by sifting sand. Some of the F2 hybrids phenotypically resembled fish of species that are specialised on sand sifting. We combined experimental behavioural and morphometric approaches to test whether the F2 hybrids are transgressive in both morphology and behaviour related to sand sifting. We then performed a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using RADseq markers to investigate the genetic architecture of morphological and behavioural traits. We show that transgression is present in several morphological traits, that novel trait combinations occur, and we observe transgressive trait values in sand sifting behaviour in some of the F2 hybrids. Moreover, we find QTLs for morphology and for sand sifting behaviour, suggesting the existence of some loci with moderate to large effects. We demonstrate that hybridization has the potential to rapidly generate novel and ecologically relevant phenotypes that may be suited to a niche neither of the parental species occupies. Interspecific hybridization may thereby contribute to the rapid generation of ecological diversity in cichlid radiations.;Feller, Anna;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.280gb5mn7;2020-08-13T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.280gb5mn7;Dryad;Data from: Rapid generation of ecologically relevant behavioural novelty in experimental cichlid hybrids;A86D72C3-AF79-4347-A8BD-B6D8CEA69B44;163338

Engaging the nucleosome Cell identity is defined by gene expression patterns that are established through the binding of specific transcription factors. However, nucleosomal units limit access of transcription factors to specific DNA motifs within the mammalian genome. To study how transcription factors bind such chromatinized, nucleosome-embedded motifs, Michael et al. focused on the pluripotency factors OCT4 and SOX2. They systematically quantified the relative affinities of these factors at different motif positions throughout the nucleosome, enabling structure determination of OCT4-SOX2-bound nucleosomes by cryo-electron microscopy. OCT4 and SOX2 bound cooperatively to strengthen DNA-binding affinity and resulted in DNA distortions that destabilized the nucleosome. This analysis reveals position-dependent binding modes that were validated in vivo, providing insights on how transcription factors read out chromatinized motifs.

This dataset is based on the interlocking network model developed by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group (GaWC) at Loughborough University (Taylor 2004). It provides one specific way to address the question how inter‐city relations can be empirically measured despite the chronic lack of data on inter‐city information flows. The model uses a proxy - intra‐firm networks of multi‐branch, multi‐location enterprises - to estimate potential flows of knowledge‐creating information between cities and towns. The method was originally developed to measure the connectivity between global cities based on multi‐branch advanced producer services (APS) firms as they organize business activities across their offices worldwide. In this dataset, the model is adapted to measure relations between functional urban areas (FUAs) within and beyond the German and Swiss space economy, for both APS and High-Tech firms. In contrast to the original methodology, in this dataset the company locations were localized by the exact, georeferenced address, not only on the level of FUAs.;"Bentlage, Michael; Heidinger, Mathias; Lüthi, Stefan; Müller, Christiane; Thierstein, Alain; Wenner, Fabian; Zöllner, Silke";10.5281/zenodo.5055713;2021-07-02T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5040740;Zenodo;Knowledge-intensive firms, connectivity and spatial restructuring: dynamics and differences in Germany and Switzerland;E52DF546-D88B-4BB9-92CB-59F341B235D7;170964
Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (kEDS) is a rare genetic heterogeneous disease clinically characterized by congenital muscle hypotonia, kyphoscoliosis, and joint hypermobility. kEDS is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in either PLOD1 or FKBP14. PLOD1 encodes the lysyl hydroxylase 1 enzyme responsible for hydroxylating lysyl residues in the collagen helix, which undergo glycosylation and form crosslinks in the extracellular matrix thus contributing to collagen fibril strength. FKBP14 encodes a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that catalyzes collagen folding and acts as a chaperone for types III, VI, and X collagen. Despite genetic heterogeneity, affected patients with mutations in either PLOD1 or FKBP14 are clinically indistinguishable. We aim to better understand the pathomechanism of kEDS to characterize distinguishing and overlapping molecular features underlying PLOD1-kEDS and FKBP14-kEDS, and to identify novel molecular targets that may expand treatment strategies. Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing of patient-derived skin fibroblasts revealed differential expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix components that are unique between PLOD1-kEDS and FKBP14-kEDS. Furthermore, we identified genes involved in inner ear development, vascular remodeling, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and protein trafficking that were differentially expressed in patient fibroblasts compared to controls. Overall, our study presents the first transcriptomics data in kEDS revealing distinct molecular features between PLOD1-kEDS and FKBP14-kEDS, and serves as a tool to better understand the disease.;"Giunta,; Hausser,; Lim,; Lindert,; Opitz,; Rohrbach,";PRJEB31335;2019-07-08T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject?term=PRJEB31335;European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database accession number PRJEB31335;Transcriptome Profiling of Primary Skin Fibroblasts Reveal Distinct Molecular Features Between PLOD1- and FKBP14-Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome;71AF1C37-A3E1-426E-B962-5AB066170547;173183

"Gesneriaceae (ca. 3400 species) is a pantropical plant family with a wide range of growth form and floral morphology that are associated with repeated adaptations to different environments and pollinators. Although Gesneriaceae systematics has been largely improved by the use of Sanger sequencing data, our understanding of the evolutionary history of the group is still far from complete due to the limited number of informative characters provided by this type of data. To overcome this limitation, we developed here a Gesneriaceae-specific gene capture kit targeting 830 single-copy loci (776,754 bp in total), including 279 genes from the Universal Angiosperm-353 kit. With an average of 557,600 reads and 87.8% gene recovery, our target capture was successful across the family Gesneriaceae and also in other families of Lamiales. From our bait set, we selected the most informative 418 loci to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire Gesneriaceae family using maximum likelihood and coalescent-based methods. Upon testing the phylogenetic performance of our baits on 78 taxa representing 20 out of 24 subtribes within the family, we showed that our data provided high support for the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages, and were able to provide high resolution within more recent radiations. Overall, the molecular resources we developed here open new perspectives for the study of Gesneriaceae phylogeny at different taxonomical levels and the identification of the factors underlying the diversification of this plant group.

Despite effective treatment, HIV can persist in latent reservoirs, which represent a major obstacle towards HIV eradication. Targeting and reactivating latent cells is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of HIV infected cells. Here, we used a primary model of HIV latency and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity during HIV latency and reactivation. Our analysis identified transcriptional programs leading to successful reactivation of HIV expression.;Ciuffi, Angela;"10.5281/zenodo.1204334 ";2018-02-12T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1204334;Zenodo;Raw paper data;D286C032-E50F-4BC8-9F80-145CCDB4D9F3;166412

The ice core was taken in the ablation zone of the Rhone Glacier in Central Swiss Alps. The expected bedrock depth was 115-119 m from two nearby hotwater drill holes. The ice core was retrieved using a thermal drill bit, i.e. that no mechanical stress was applied to the at least -0.5°C warm temperate ice. Furthermore, this procedure allowed an oriented retrieval of the ice. The site pointing towards east was marked using a soldering iron causing small gaps in the ice segments at both ends. Due to several technical issues the drilling was stopped at 45 m and continued in a new borehole approximately 80 cm down-glacier. The second hole was drilled down to 45 m with a hotwater drilling system before continuing a successful ice coring at 50 m. At 80 m the procedure was stopped again due to larger grains of gravel found in the ice. A total of 112 ice core segments with a mean diameter of 70 mm and a mean length of 700 mm were retrieved and stored at -25°C after transporting down the glacier.;"Bauder, Andreas; Eichler, Jan; Hellmann, Sebastian; Jansen, Daniela; Kerch, Johanna; Maurer, Hansruedi; Schwikowski, Margit; Weikusat, Ilka";10.1594/PANGAEA.888517;;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.888517;PANGAEA;Large Area Scan Macroscope images of ice core samples collected from the temperate Alpine ice core Rhone_2017;26478781-9CEE-4B57-9EAD-51FFDD824C4B;169329

The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are tightly linked. The generation of ROS can be both the cause and a consequence of ER stress pathways, and an increasing number of human diseases are characterized by tissue atrophy in response to ER stress and oxidative injury. For the assessment of modulators of ER luminal ROS generation and for mechanistic studies, methods to monitor changes in ER reduction-oxidation (redox) states in a time-resolved and organelle-specific manner are needed. This has been greatly facilitated by the development of genetically encoded fluorescent probes, which can be targeted to different subcellular locations by specific amino acid extensions. One of these probes is the yellow fluorescent protein-based redox biosensor, HyPer. Here, we provide a protocol for the time-resolved monitoring of the oxidizing milieu in the ER of adherent mammalian cells using the ratiometric sensor, HyPerER, which is specifically targeted to the ER lumen.;"Appenzeller-Herzog, Christian; Birk, Julia; Lizak, Beata; Odermatt, Alex";10.5281/zenodo.5082260;2021-07-05T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5082260;Zenodo;Data_Fig1_Monitoring Changes in the Oxidizing Milieu in the Endoplasmic Reticulum of Mammalian Cells Using HyPerERER.;9DB51BB7-EC88-4523-8738-38B7C4A48382;179400

Bile acids control lipid homeostasis by regulating uptake from food and excretion. Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity.

Echinococcus multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a rising zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere. Treatment of this fatal disease is limited to chemotherapy using benzimidazoles and surgical intervention, with frequent disease recurrence in cases without radical surgery. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying E. multilocularis infections and host-parasite interactions ultimately aids developing novel therapeutic options. This study explored an involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS) during E. multilocularis infection in mice.E. multilocularis- and mock-infected C57BL/6 mice were subdivided into vehicle, albendazole (ABZ) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (αPD-L1) treated groups. To mimic a chronic infection, treatments of mice started six weeks post i.p. infection and continued for another eight weeks. Liver tissue was then collected to examine inflammatory cytokines and the expression of UPR- and ERS-related genes.E. multilocularis infection led to an upregulation of UPR- and ERS-related proteins in the liver, including ATF6, CHOP, GRP78, ERp72, H6PD and calreticulin, whilst PERK and its target eIF2α were not affected, and IRE1α and ATF4 were downregulated. ABZ treatment in E. multilocularis infected mice reversed, or at least tended to reverse, these protein expression changes to levels seen in mock-infected mice. Furthermore, ABZ treatment reversed the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ in the liver of infected mice. Similar to ABZ, αPD-L1 immune-treatment tended to reverse the increased CHOP and decreased ATF4 and IRE1α expression levels.AE caused chronic inflammation, UPR activation and ERS in mice. The E. multilocularis-induced inflammation and consecutive ERS was ameliorated by ABZ and αPD-L1 treatment, indicating their effectiveness to inhibit parasite proliferation and downregulate its activity status. Neither ABZ nor αPD-L1 themselves affected UPR in control mice. Further research is needed to elucidate the link between inflammation, UPR and ERS, and if these pathways offer potential for improved therapies of patients with AE.;"Beldi, Guido; Gottstein, Bruno; Jebbawi, Fadi; Lundström-Stadelmann, Britta; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon; Wang, Junhua; Weingartner, Michael";10.5281/zenodo.5838107;2022-03-03T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5838107;zenodo;Data_Figure2_Albendazole reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by Echinococcus multilocularis in mice;2874CF1A-4158-4224-A1BC-3C2940BE5B99;179400

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

"<p>Although social transmission mechanisms of animal cultures are well studied, little is known about the origins of behavioral innovations, even in established tool users such as chimpanzees. Previous work has suggested that wild chimpanzees are especially prone to engaging with tools during extended periods of low food availability and after long travel, supporting the hypothesis that cultural innovation is facilitated by necessity revealing opportunities. Here, we tested this hypothesis with a field experiment that directly compared subjects' immediate variation in measures of current energy balance with their interest in a novel foraging problem, liquid honey enclosed in an apparatus accessible by tool use. We found that the previous distance traveled directly predicted subjects' manipulations of both the apparatus and the tool, whereas previous feeding time was negatively correlated to manipulation time. We conclude that ""necessity"" augments chimpanzees' likelihood of engaging with ecological ""opportunities,"" suggesting that both factors are scaffolding foraging innovation in this and potentially other species.</p>";"Gruber, Thibaud; Grund, Charlotte; Neumann, Christof; Zuberbühler, Klaus";https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/30/4/1136/5486737;2019-01-26T00:00:00Z;https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:120755;Repository;Necessity creates opportunities for chimpanzee tool use;A6560068-69CC-4502-BB2E-45D9F3C1DE6D;166458
While vegetation has intensively been surveyed on mountain summits, limitedknowledge exists about the diversity and community structure of soil biota. Here, westudy how climatic variables, vegetation, parent material, soil properties, and slopeaspect affect the soil microbiome on 10 GLORIA (Global Observation Research Initiativein Alpine environments) mountain summits ranging from the lower alpine to the nival zonein Switzerland. At these summits we sampled soils from all four aspects and examinedhow the bacterial and fungal communities vary by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing.We found that mountain summit soils contain highly diverse microbial communities witha total of 10,406 bacterial and 6,291 fungal taxa. Bacterial a-diversity increased withincreasing soil pH and decreased with increasing elevation, whereas fungal a-diversitydid not change significantly. Soil pH was the strongest predictor for microbial b-diversity.Bacterial and fungal community structures exhibited a significant positive relationshipwith plant communities, indicating that summits with a more distinct plant compositionalso revealed more distinct microbial communities. The influence of elevation wasstronger than aspect on the soil microbiome. Several microbial taxa responded toelevation and soil pH. Chloroflexi and Mucoromycota were significantly more abundanton summits at higher elevations, whereas the relative abundance of Basidiomycotaand Agaricomycetes decreased with elevation. Most bacterial OTUs belonging to thephylum Acidobacteria were indicators for siliceous parent material and several OTUsbelonging to the phylum Planctomycetes were associated with calcareous soils. Thetrends for fungi were less clear. Indicator OTUs belonging to the genera Mortierella andNaganishia showed a mixed response to parent material, demonstrating their ubiquitousand opportunistic behaviour in soils. Overall, fungal communities responded weakly toabiotic and biotic factors. In contrast, bacterial communities were strongly influencedby environmental changes suggesting they will be strongly affected by future climatechange and associated temperature increase and an upward migration of vegetation.Our results provide the first insights into the soil microbiome of mountain summits inthe European Alps that are shaped as a result of highly variable local environmentalconditions and may help to predict responses of the soil biota to global climate change.;"Adamczyk, Magdalene; Frey, Beat";PRJNA509562;2018-12-12T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA509562;NCBI Sequence Read Archive;Raw Sequences;EC0E3F62-E58D-46F9-BA09-ABA97A3CE6F4;172464

Due to climate warming, alpine ecosystems arechanging rapidly. Ongoing upward migrations ofplants and thus an increase of easily decomposablesubstrates will strongly affect the soil microbiome.To understand how belowground communities willrespond to such changes, we set up an incubationexperiment with permafrost and active soil layersfrom northern (NW) and southern (SE) slopes of amountain ridge on Muot da Barba Peider in the SwissAlps and incubated them with or without artificialroot exudates (AREs) at two temperatures, 4C or15C. The addition of AREs resulted in elevated respirationacross all soil types. Bacterial and fungal alphadiversity decreased significantly, coinciding withstrong shifts in microbial community structure inARE-treated soils. These shifts in bacterial communitystructure were driven by an increased abundanceof fast-growing copiotrophic taxa. Fungalcommunities were predominantly affected by AREsin SE active layer soils and shifted towards fastgrowingopportunistic yeast. In contrast, in the colderNW facing active layer and permafrost soils fungalcommunities were more influenced by temperaturechanges. These findings demonstrate the sensitivityof soil microbial communities in high alpine ecosystemsto climate change and how shifts in these communitiesmay lead to functional changes impactingbiogeochemical processes.;"Adamczyk, Magdalene; Frey, Beat";PRJNA673329;2020-11-10T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA673329;NCBI Sequence Read Archive;Raw Sequences;EBDB6047-D132-4ABB-BC21-D25E22F3BDD9;172464

Die Arbeiten erfolgen in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Staatsarchiv des Kantons Aargau und sind auf vier Jahre angelegt. Mit Unterstützung des Zürcher Rechtsquellenprojekts der Schweizerischen Rechtsquellenstiftung streben wir eine digitale Edition an, welche die wesentlichen Vorteile aktueller technischer Möglichkeiten nutzt, die Dokumente adäquat auszeichnet, gezielt miteinander verknüpft und für neue Zugriffsmöglichkeiten aufbereitet. Das Rückgrat des Unternehmens bildet der verhältnismässig geschlossene Bestand der überlieferten mittelalterlichen und frühneuzeitlichen Einzelblattdokumente des Klosters (STAAG U.17, 1291-1789), der - erweitert um auswärtige Stücke aus dem einstigen Kloster - in seiner historischen Entwicklung und in seinen wandelbaren Ordnungen nachvollziehbar gemacht werden soll. Aufgrund von nachträglich auf den Urkunden aufgebrachten Dorsualnotizen und Signaturen sollen historische Archivordnungen rekonstruiert sowie die späteren Abschriften dieser Urkunden nachgewiesen und verlinkt werden. So kann die Edition zugleich die Umorganisation und Umdeutung dieses Bestandes erschliessen. Wir nutzen die besondere Beweglichkeit einer digitalen Edition, um der Forschung in neuartiger Weise Entwicklungen eines Bestandes und dahinterliegende Umbrüche in der Schrift- und Administrationskultur zugänglich zu machen. Zugleich soll das Projekt Möglichkeiten digitalen Edierens im fachlichen Austausch reflektieren und vorantreiben.Mit dem historisch herausragenden Dokumenten- und Kopialbuchbestand der habsburgischen Klosterstiftung und der späteren Berner Landvogtei stellt die Edition bislang weitgehend fehlende Arbeitsgrundlagen für aktuelle Forschungsrichtungen bereit. Die Königsfelder Dokumente sind von höchstem Interesse für die Kunst-, Kultur-, Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte (vom Klosteralltag über den Klosterhaushalt bis hin zu Hofhaltung und Armenfürsorge), für die historischen Gender Studies und die Ordens- und Reformationsgeschichte. Zugleich wird unsere Edition neuen Ansätzen der Schweizer Geschichte entgegenkommen. Denn sie macht Gemengelagen zwischen unterschiedlichen Herrschaften (Habsburg, Kloster als Territorialherr, eidgenössische Orte) ebenso wie lokale Dimensionen von Staatsbildung, Territorialisierung und Konfessionalisierung fassbar. Das Projekt wird an der Universität Zürich angesiedelt, zielt auf eine enge Verkopplung von Editionsarbeit mit wissenschaftlicher Forschung und Lehre und wird Studierende mit Editionstechniken und archivalischen Gegebenheiten vertraut machen. Ausserdem wird das Projekt in Kooperation mit dem Staatsarchiv Aargau, dem Museum Aargau sowie weiteren Institutionen einen Beitrag zur Geschichtsvermittlung und Kulturgüterpflege leisten.Das Projekt…- rekonstruiert und ediert einen historischen Dokumentenbestand und erschliesst weitere bislang kaum edierte Typen klösterlicher und herrschaftlicher Quellen- unterstützt neue, über das «Werden und Wachsen der Eidgenossenschaft» hinausblickende Zugänge zur Geschichte der Schweiz- leistet einen Beitrag zur Weiterentwicklung der offenen digitalen Edition- wendet sich mit akademischer Lehre und über Kooperationen direkt an Studierende und ein grösseres Publikum;"Barwitzki, Lukas; Egloff, Salome; Halter-Pernet, Colette; Henggeler, Fabian; Hodel, Tobias; Nadig, Michael; Steinmann, Anina; Stettler, Sabine; Teuscher, Simon";doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5179360.;2021-10-26T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5179361;ZENODO;Charters and Records of Königsfelden Abbey and Bailiwick (1308-1662);3B371F55-8358-4E5F-ACC6-FDB3128916FA;157907

The collective movement of African trypanosomes on semi-solid surfaces, known as social motility, is presumed to be due to migration factors and repellents released by the parasites. Here we show that procyclic (insect midgut) forms acidify their environment as a consequence of glucose metabolism, generating pH gradients by diffusion. Early and late procyclic forms exhibit self-organising properties on agarose plates. While early procyclic forms are repelled by acid and migrate outwards, late procyclic forms remain at the inoculation site. Furthermore, trypanosomes respond to exogenously formed pH gradients, with both early and late procyclic forms being attracted to alkali. pH taxis is mediated by multiple cyclic AMP effectors: deletion of one copy of adenylate cyclase ACP5, or both copies of the cyclic AMP response protein CARP3, abrogates the response to acid, while deletion of phosphodiesterase PDEB1 completely abolishes pH taxis. The ability to sense pH is biologically relevant as trypanosomes experience large changes as they migrate through their tsetse host. Supporting this, a CARP3 null mutant is severely compromised in its ability to establish infections in flies. Based on these findings, we propose that the expanded family of adenylate cyclases in trypanosomes might govern other chemotactic responses in their two hosts.;Roditi, Isabel;PXD030766;2022-02-17T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD030766;ProteomeXchange;pH taxis in African trypanosomes;71D640ED-A9E5-496D-8390-46BE9A619C78;184669

The genomic database contains data from a total of 198 bacterial genomes, as detailed in the database metafile (see file descriptions here below). It has been tested on the Western and Eastern honey bee (Apis mellifera, Apis cerana), for which it has been shown to recruit about 90% of all the reads in most metagenomic samples (excluding host-derived reads). The database also contains genomes derived from other bee species, such as bumble bees, but it has not been tested with metagenomic data for these bee species yet. Most species in the database are represented by multiple genomes, but still with a maximum of 98.5% gANI (genomic average nucleotide identity) between genomes. Thus, several published genomes isolated from social bees are not included.;Engel, Philipp;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4661061;2021-04-03T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/4661061#.Y85EF-zMJTY;zenodo;The honey bee gut microbiota genomic database;892C97BB-9E1F-4BE1-8919-8AB417B33F91;179487

Aerosol properties were measured between February 8 and March 31 2019 at the measurement site Weissfluhjoch (LON: 9.806475, LAT: 46.832964). Optical and aerodynamic particle counters, as well as a scanning mobility particle size spectrometer and an ice nuclei counter were deployed to report particle concentrations and size distributions in fine (10-1000 nm) and coarse mode (> 1000 nm), cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (CCNCs), and ice nuclei particle concentrations (ICNCs). The ambient particles were transported via a heated inlet to be distributed to the particle detecting devices inside the setup room.Optical Particle Counter (OPC): Light scattering of a diode laser beam caused by travelling particles is used in the both, the OPC-N3 (0.41 - 38.5 μm) and GT-526S (0.3 - 5 μm), to determine their size and number concentration. For the OPC-N3, particle size spectra and concentration data are used afterwards to calculate PM₁, PM₂,₅ and PM₁₀ (assumptions: particle density: 1.65 g cm³, refractive index: 1.5+i0).Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS): The APS (3321, TSI Inc.) measured the particle size distribution for aerodynamic diameters between 0.5 μm and ~20 μm by the particle’s time-of-flight and light-scattering intensity (assumptions: particle density 1 g cm³).Scanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS): Particle number concentrations in a size range between 12 and 460 nm (electrical mobility diameter) were measured at Davos Wolfgang, using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer Spectrometer (SMPS 3938, TSI Inc.). The classifier (3082, TSI Inc.) was equipped with a neutralizer (3088, TSI Inc.) and a differential mobility analyzer working with negative polarity (3081, TSI Inc.). The size selected particles were counted by a water-based condensation particle counter (3787 TSI Inc.). The TSI AIM software was used to provide particle size distributions by applying multiple charge and diffusion loss corrections (assumptions: particle density 1 g cm³).Coriolis μ and LINDA: A microbial air sampler (Coriolis μ, bertin Instruments) was used to collect airborne particles for investigating their ice nucleating ability with a droplet freezing device. Particles larger than 0.5 μm were drawn with an air flow rate of up to 300 l min‾¹ into the cone and centrifuged into the wall of the cone due to the forming vortex. The liquid sample was transferred into the LED based Ice Nucleation Detection Apparatus (LINDA, University of Basel) to study heterogeneous ice formation (immersion freezing mode) of ambient airborne particles.;"Rösch, Carolin; Wieder, Jörg";doi: 10.16904/envidat.156;2020-05-26T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/aerosol-data-weissfluhjoch;Envidat;Aerosol Data Weissfluhjoch;A5E6E399-7F1E-40C8-81EA-05FB960B050F;175824

"The goal of this study was (i) to quantify the mechanoresponse of this array of potential blood markers for joint pathology (COMP, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, CPII, C2C, C2C/CPII, ADAMTS-4, PRG-4, IL-6 and resistin) to a walking stress test in patients with knee OA and to determine the correlation (ii) among the kinetics of these blood markers, (iii) with accumulated knee load during the walking stress, and (iv) with patient reported osteoarthritis outcome and QoL.The dataset includes 24 patients with knee osteoarthritis scheduled to receive high tibial osteotomy. All participants completed questionnaires, and a walking stress test with six blood samples analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1, -3, and -9, epitope resulting from cleavage of type II collagen by collagenases (C2C), type II procollagen (CPII), interleukin (IL)-6, proteoglycan (PRG)-4, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-4, and resistin, and gait analysis. Joint load was computed from gait analysis data and musculoskeletal modelling in OpenSim.

The role of interspecific hybridization in evolution is still being debated. Interspecific hybridization has on the one hand been suggested to facilitate the evolution of ecological novelty and hence the invasion of new niches and adaptive radiation when ecological opportunity is present beyond the parental species niches. On the other hand, hybrids between two ecologically divergent species may perform less well than parental species in their respective niches because hybrids would be intermediate in performance in both niches. The evolutionary consequences of hybridization may hence be context-dependent, depending on whether additional ecological opportunities do or do not exist. Surprisingly, these complementary predictions may never have been tested in the same experiment in animals. To do so, we investigate if hybrids between ecologically distinct cichlid species perform less well than the parental types when feeding on food either parental species are adapted to, and if the same hybrids perform better compared to their parents when feeding on food none of the species are adapted to. We generated two first-generation experimental hybrid crosses between species of African cichlids. In feeding efficiency experiments we measure the performance of hybrids and parental species on food types representing both parental species niches and additional ‘novel’ niches, not utilized by part of the parental species but by other species in the African cichlid radiations. We found that hybrids can have higher feeding efficiencies on the ‘novel’ food types but typically have lower efficiencies on parental food types when compared to parental species. This suggests that hybridization can generate functional variation that can be of ecological relevance allowing the access to resources outside of either parental species niche. Hence, we provide support for the hypothesis of ecological context-dependency of the evolutionary impact of interspecific hybridization.;Selz, Oliver;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m25t886;2019-10-14T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m25t886;Dryad;Data from: Interspecific hybridization can generate functional novelty in cichlid fish;6027E107-E323-4C9D-B073-48533B88837A;163338
Rates of speciation vary tremendously among evolutionary lineages, with our understanding of what fuels the rapid succession of speciation events within young adaptive radiations remaining particularly incomplete. The cichlid fish family provides the most notable example of such variation among extant metazoans. It includes many slowly speciating lineages as well as the several exceptionally large and rapid adaptive radiations. By reconstructing a large phylogeny of all described cichlid species, we show that explosive speciation is solely concentrated in several large yet young lake species flocks. Across the family, speciation rate increases are associated with absence of top predators, and speciation rate decreases are associated with arid climate, but these factors are not nearly sufficient to explain explosive speciation in lake radiations, in particular the Lake Victoria adaptive radiation. Across lake radiations we observe a positive relationship between speciation rate and enrichment with large indel polymorphisms. Assembly of one hundred Victorian cichlid genomes comprising all extant ecological guilds and taxonomic genera reveals this radiation contains exceptional ‘genomic potential’ - hundreds of ancient haplotypes bearing indel polymorphisms, many of which are strongly associated with specific ecologies and are shared with ecologically similar species from other older lake radiations elsewhere in Africa. Network analysis reveals fundamentally non-treelike evolution through recombining old haplotypes, with origins of ecological guilds concentrated early in the Victoria radiation. Our results suggest that the combination of ecological opportunity, sexual selection and exceptional genomic potential is the key to understanding explosive adaptive radiation.;McGee, Matt;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fn2z34tr0;2020-09-21T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fn2z34tr0;Dryad;Data from: The ecological and genomic basis of explosive adaptive radiation;34EA930B-4607-4FD6-8C1D-46C84C088A2A;163338
One hallmark of the East African cichlid radiations is the rapid evolution of reproductive isolation that is robust to full sympatry of many closely related species. Theory predicts that species persistence and speciation in sympatry with gene flow are facilitated if loci of large effect or physical linkage (or pleiotropy) underlie traits involved in reproductive isolation. Here we investigate the genetic architecture of a key trait involved in behavioural isolation, male nuptial coloration, by crossing two sister species pairs of Lake Victoria cichlids of the genus Pundamilia and mapping nuptial coloration in the F2 hybrids. One is a young sympatric species pair, representative of an axis of colour motif differentiation, red-dorsum vs blue, that is highly recurrent in closely related sympatric species. The other is a species pair representative of colour motifs, red-chest vs blue, that are common in allopatric but uncommon in sympatric closely related species. We find significant QTLs with moderate to large effects (some overlapping) for red and yellow in the sympatric red-dorsum x blue cross, whereas we find no significant QTLs in the non-sympatric red-chest x blue cross. These findings are consistent with theory predicting that large effect loci or linkage/pleiotropy underlying mating trait differentiation could facilitate speciation and species persistence with gene flow in sympatry.;Feller, Anna;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5tb2rbp1n;2020-03-25T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5tb2rbp1n;Dryad;Genetic architecture of a key reproductive isolation trait differs between sympatric and non-sympatric sister species of Lake Victoria cichlids;9D6906CE-7413-40A5-ADBE-3AB82E2252A2;163338

Previous studies have characterized code comments in various programming languages, showing how high quality of code comments is crucial to support program comprehension activities, and to improve the effectiveness of maintenance tasks. However, very few studies have focused on understanding developer practices to write comments. None of them has compared such developer practices to the standard comment guidelines to study the extent to which developers follow the guidelines. This paper reports the first empirical study investigating commenting practices in Pharo Smalltalk. First, we analyze class comment evolution over seven Pharo versions. Then, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the information types embedded in class comments. Finally, we study the adherence of developer commenting practices to the official class comment template over Pharo versions.The results of this study show that there is a rapid increase in class comments in the initial three Pharo versions, while in subsequent versions developers added comments to both new and old classes, thus maintaining a similar code to comment ratio. We furthermore found three times as many information types in class comments as those suggested by the template. However, the information types suggested by the template tend to be present more often than other types of information. Additionally, we find that a substantial proportion of comments follow the writing style of the template in writing these information types, but they are written and formatted in a non-uniform way. This suggests the need to standardize the commenting guidelines for formatting the text, and to provide headers for the different information types to ensure a consistent style and to identify the information easily. Given the importance of high-quality code comments, we draw numerous implications for developers and researchers to improve the support for comment quality assessment tools.;Rani, Pooja;https://github.com/poojaruhal/CommentAnalysisInPharo;2021-05-13T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/poojaruhal/CommentAnalysisInPharo;Github;What do class comments tell us?

The IOC was the first international sports organization based in Switzerland. Its founder - the French Baron Pierre de Coubertin (1863-1937) - endowed it with a system of values that stem from a long tradition of European understanding of humanitarianism and its predecessors. The IOC had to face major challenges in the 20th century when it was overtaken by state diplomacy, which made sport one of the tools of its soft power.  This project extends beyond the classical institutional approach by studying the trajectories of its members. This project reconstructs the family, professional, social and political trajectories of the 213 IOC members co-opted before 1972. It also deciphers the mechanisms of co-optation and the decision-making procedures specific to the IOC. Finally, it assesses the “lowest social, cultural and political denominator” common to all of these leaders, which defines their worldview, and questions the concepts of apolitical (sport) and diplomatic (IOC) neutrality. Based on a prosopographical approach (cross-referencing and serialization of micro-biographies), the project is situated at the intersection of the history of sport, cultural diplomacy, political cultures, the circulation of elites on a global scale and cosmopolitanism. It thus contributes to the history of international organizations based in Switzerland and a better understanding of the concepts of pacifism and neutrality.;"Carpentier, Florence; Clastres, Patrick; Klima, Helena";http://ark.dasch.swiss/ark:/72163/1/0114;2020-05-21T00:00:00Z;https://www.dasch.swiss/olympiccommittee;DaSCH;The International Olympic Committee members (1894-1972).

We use a sample of sources from the Swift (Gehrels et al., 2004ApJ...611.1005G) BAT 70-Month Hard X-ray Survey catalog (Baumgartner et al., 2013, Cat. J/ApJS/207/19), which contains 1210 sources including 292 Seyfert 1s. By cross-correlating the Swift/BAT catalog with the Veron catalog (Veron-Cetty & Veron, 2010, Cat. VII/258), we selected only narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLSy1s) and Seyfert 1s-1.5s (Sy1s-1.5s). Our sample is in this way composed of 102 sources, divided in 37 Sy1.0s, 18 Sy1.2s, 35 Sy1.5s, and 12 NLSy1s. We selected sources that have been observed with the XMM-Newton satellite (Jansen et al., 2001A&A...365L...1J) as pointed observations with a minimum exposure time of 5 ks (see Table A.1). We selected sources with a flux higher than 10-11ergs/s/cm^2^ in the 14-195keV band. BAT spectra (Barthelmy et al., 2005SSRv..120..143B) have been obtained from the Swift/BAT website.

Hydra possesses three distinct stem cell populations that continuously self-renew and prevent aging in Hydra vulgaris. However sexual animals from the H. oligactis cold-sensitive (Ho_CS) strain develop an aging phenotype upon gametogenesis induction, initiated by the loss of interstitial stem cells. Animals stop regenerating, lose their active behaviors and die within three months. This phenotype is not observed in the cold-resistant Ho_CR strain. To dissect the mechanisms of Hydra aging, we compared the self-renewal of epithelial stem cells in these two strains and found it irreversibly reduced in aging Ho_CS while sustained in non-aging Ho_CR. We also identified a deficient autophagy in Ho_CS epithelial cells, with a constitutive deficiency in autophagosome formation as detected with the mCherry-eGFP-LC3A/B autophagy sensor, an inefficient response to starvation as evidenced by the accumulation of the autophagosome cargo protein p62/SQSTM1, and a poorly-inducible autophagy flux upon proteasome inhibition. In the non-aging H. vulgaris animals, the blockade of autophagy by knocking-down WIPI2 suffices to induce aging. This study highlights the essential role of a dynamic autophagy flux to maintain epithelial stem cell renewal and prevent aging.;"Galliot, Brigitte; Tomczyk, Szymon";Hydratlas.unige.ch;2020-01-23T00:00:00Z;https://hydratlas.unige.ch/blast/datasets/SignificanceB_proteinGroups_eLife.csv;Hydratlas server;Proteomics dataset from aging and non-aging Hydra oligactis - proteinGroups_eLife;14A93395-8E4C-44B5-902E-CB4741F9921F;169930

More than a decade ago it was proposed that the collective migration of African trypanosomes on semi-solidsurfaces could be explained by a combination of migration factors and repellents released by the parasites, but the identity of these molecules was unknown. Here we show that procyclic (insect midgut) forms acidify their environment as a consequence of glucose metabolism, generating pH gradients by diffusion. Early and late procyclic forms exhibit self-organising propertieson surfaces. Both forms are attracted to alkali, but while early procyclic forms are repelled by acid and migrate outwards, late procyclic forms remain at the inoculation site. pH taxis relieson cyclic AMP signalling. Acid sensing requires a flagellar adenylate cyclase, ACP5, and a cyclic AMP response protein, CARP3, that interacts with ACP5. Deletion of the flagellar phosphodiesterase PDEB1 abolishes pH taxis completely. Trypanosomes can also respond to exogenously formed gradients. pH sensing is likely to be biologically relevant as trypanosomes experience large differences in pH as they progress through their tsetse fly host. In addition, self-generated gradients may help reinforce directionality. Moreover, since trypanosomes encode a large family of adenylate cyclases, these may govern other chemotactic responses and tissue tropisms in both the mammal and the fly.;Roditi, Isabel;PRJEB41935;2021-07-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB41935?show=reads;European Nucleotide Archive;pH taxis in trypanosomes;19C62B25-4DE0-437A-A1C5-9C9D07529D2A;184669

The fundamental band gaps of liquid water and hexagonal ice are calculated through advanced electronic-structure methods. We compare specifically the performance of state-of-the-art GW calculations with nonempirical hybrid functionals. For the latter, we fix the free parameters either through the dielectric response of the material or through enforcing Koopmans' condition to localized states. The various approaches yield consistent band gaps, in good agreement with available experimental references. Furthermore, we discuss the critical aspects of each approach that underlie the band-gap predictions.;Bischoff, Thomas;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:6j-5p;2021-06-28T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2021.97;Materials Cloud;Band gaps of liquid water and hexagonal ice through advanced electronic-structure calculations;BFBE6B23-B820-4A90-9CB9-01D6FF38E300;172524

We determine the transition levels of electron and hole polarons at the BiVO4-water interface through thermodynamic integration within a hybrid functional scheme, thereby accounting for the liquid nature of the water component. The electron polaron is found to be less stable at the interface than in the bulk by 0.18 eV, while for the hole polaron the binding energy increases by 0.20 eV when the charge localizes in the surface layer of BiVO4. These results indicate that interfacial effects on the polaron binding energy and charge distribution are sizeable and cannot trivially be inferred from bulk calculations.;Wiktor, Julia;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:2019.0035/v1;2019-07-01T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2019.0035/v1;Materials Cloud;Electron and Hole Polarons at the BiVO4–Water Interface;E57CC975-CDF3-462F-8007-3BE853FE271E;172524
We describe a nonempirical procedure for achieving accurate band gaps of extended systems through the insertion of suitably defined potential probes. By enforcing Koopmans' condition on the resulting localized electronic states, we determine the optimal fraction of Fock exchange to be used in the adopted hybrid functional. As potential probes, we consider point defects, the hydrogen interstitial, and various adjustable potentials that allow us to vary the energy level of the localized state in the band gap. By monitoring the delocalized screening charge, we achieve a measure of the degree of hybridization with the band states, which can be used to improve the band-gap estimate. Application of this methodology to AlP, C, and MgO yields band gaps differing by less than 0.2 eV from experiment.;Bischoff, Thomas;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:2019.0039/v1;2019-08-08T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2019.0039/v1;Materials Cloud;Adjustable potential probes for band-gap predictions of extended systems through nonempirical hybrid functionals;DEF5F9AF-171D-4E77-83BA-A0DCF302F933;172524

We extend the quasiparticle self-consistent approach beyond the GW approximation by using a range-separated vertex function. The developed approach yields band gaps, dielectric constants, and band positions with an accuracy similar to highest-level electronic-structure calculations without exceeding the cost of regular quasiparticle self-consistent GW. We introduce an exchange-correlation kernel that accounts for the vertex over the full spatial range. In the long range it complies with the Ward identity, while it is approximated through the adiabatic local density functional in the short range. In this approach, the renormalization factor is balanced and the higher-order diagrams are effectively taken into account.;Tal, Aelexey;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:hb-v3;2021-08-17T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2021.140;Materials Cloud;Vertex function compliant with the Ward identity for quasiparticle self-consistent calculations beyond GW;418052BA-F449-4E88-83D7-33FA0E734C73;172524
We present an efficient procedure for constructing nonempirical hybrid functionals to accurately predict band gaps of extended systems. We determine mixing parameters by enforcing the generalized Koopmans’ condition on localized electron states, which are achieved by inserting an optimized potential probe. Application of this scheme to a large set of materials yields band gaps with a mean error of 0.30 eV with respect to experiment. Next, we consider a perturbative one-shot approach in which the single- particle eigenvalues are calculated with the wave functions obtained at the semilocal level. In this way, the computational cost is reduced by ∼85% without loss of accuracy. The scheme is found to be robust upon consideration of different defect species and functional forms.;Yang, Jing;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:9b-zz;2022-03-15T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2022.40;Materials Cloud;One-shot approach for enforcing piecewise linearity on hybrid functionals: application to band-gap predictions;3BB1F1DF-949C-4B1B-A15F-922AB99C5639;172524

Global change causes community composition to change considerably through time, with ever-new combinations of interacting species. To study the consequences of newly established species interactions, one available source of data could be observational surveys from biodiversity monitoring. However, approaches using observational data would need to account for niche differences between species and for imperfect detection of individuals. To estimate population sizes of interacting species, we extended N-mixture models that were developed to estimate true population sizes in single species. Simulations revealed that our model is able to disentangle direct effects of dominant on subordinate species from indirect effects of dominant species on detection probability of subordinate species. For illustration, we applied our model to data from a Swiss amphibian monitoring program and showed that sizes of expanding water frog populations were negatively related to population sizes of endangered yellow-bellied toads and common midwife toads and partly of natterjack toads. Unlike other studies that analyzed presence and absence of species, our model suggests that the spread of water frogs in Central Europe is one of the reasons for the decline of endangered toad species. Thus, studying population impacts of dominant species on population sizes of endangered species using data from biodiversity monitoring programs should help to inform conservation policy and to decide whether competing species should be subject to population management.;"Amhein, V; Bühler, C; Roth, T";10.5061/dryad.7gt4m.;2015-10-20T00:00:00Z;http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7gt4m;DRYAD;Data from: Estimating effects of species interactions on populations of endangered species;C13D8C93-EF3D-40EF-AE58-24755B5EA9CD;156294

arasites. Over the past decade, it has been shown that Alba-domain proteins contribute to developmental regulation in protozoan parasites. Trypanosoma brucei, responsible for human sleeping sickness, progresses through distinct life cycle stages as it cycles between its mammalian and tsetse fly host. T. brucei has 4 Alba-domain proteins that have been shown to interact with each other and with proteins of the translation machinery. Here we describe deletion mutants of two Alba-domain proteins, Alba3 and Alba4, and the requirements for them in bloodstream forms and during the transition to procyclic forms. We show that deletion of Alba3 or Alba4 does not have an effect on parasite’s survival as bloodstream forms and that Alba3 and Alba4 are functionally redundant in bloodstream forms. In contrast, only Alba3 can support successful differentiation from the stumpy to the procyclic form. Comparative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of the Alba3 deletion mutant and wild-type parasites during differentiation, together with polysome profile analysis shows that differentiation regulation by Alba3 is achieved by extensive remodeling of the proteome. In summary, our studies show that Alba3 plays an important role in remodeling the proteome at the level of translation during differentiation of stumpy forms to procyclic forms.;RODITI, ISABEL;PRJEB38690;2020-12-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB38690?show=reads;European Nucleotide Archive;An Alba-domain protein required for proteome remodeling during differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei;82FF37B9-8B0A-495F-9E01-24FCB5EFC15C;184669

Purpose: Tumor control probability (TCP) models based on Poisson statistics characterize the distribution of surviving clonogens. Thus enabling the calculation of TCP for individuals. To mathematically describe clinically observed survival data of patient cohorts it is necessary to extend the Poisson TCP model. This is typically done by either incorporating variations of model parameters or by using an empirical logistic model. The purpose of this work is the development of an analytical population TCP model by mechanistic extension of the Possion model.Methods and materials: The frequency distribution of gross tumor volumes was used to incorporate tumor volume variations into the TCP model. Additionally the tumor cell density variation was incorporated. Both versions of the population TCP model were fitted to clinical data and compared to existing literature.Results: It was shown that clinically observed brain tumor volumes of dogs undergoing radiotherapy are distributed according to an exponential distribution. The average gross tumor volume size was 3.37 cm3. Fitting the population TCP model including the volume variation using linear-quadratic and track-event model yieldedα=0.36Gy--1a, β=0.045Gy--2, a=0.9yr--1, TD=5.0d,and p=.36Gy--1, q=0.48Gy--1, a=0.80yr--1, TD=3.0d, respectively. Fitting the population TCP model including both the volume and cell density variation yielded α=0.43Gy--1, β=0.0537Gy--2, a=2.0yr--1, TD=3.0d, σ=2.5,and p=.43Gy--1, q=0.55Gy--1, a=2.0yr--1, TD=2.0d, σ=3.0,respectively.Conclusions: Two sets of radiobiological parameters were obtained which can be used for quantifying the TCP for radiation therapy of brain tumors in dogs. We established a mechanistic link between the poisson statistics based individual TCP model and the logistic TCP model. This link can be used to determine the radiobiological parameters of patient specific TCP models from published fits of logistic models to cohorts of patients.;Rohrer Bley, Carla;https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TTCXFX;2023-01-04T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TTCXFX;Harvard Dataverse;"Replication Data for ""A Novel Analytical Population Tumor Control Probability Model...""";0EE8B75E-FD0B-4288-A936-C8D7ED6C200B;182490

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Previous work suggested that titi monkeys <i>Callicebus nigrifrons</i> combine two alarm calls, the A- and B-calls, to communicate about predator type and location. To explore how listeners process these sequences, we recorded alarm call sequences of six free-ranging groups exposed to terrestrial and aerial predator models, placed on the ground or in the canopy, and used multimodel inference to assess the information encoded in the sequences. We then carried out playback experiments to identify the features used by listeners to react to the available information. Results indicated that information about predator type and location were encoded by the proportion of B-call pairs relative to all call pairs of the sequence (i.e., proportion of BB-grams). The results suggest that the meaning of the sequence is not conveyed in a categorical but probabilistic manner. We discuss the implications of these findings for current theories of animal communication and language evolution.;"Berthet, Mélissa; Cäsar, Cristiane; Mesbahi, Geoffrey; Neumann, Christof; Pajot, Aude; Zuberbuhler, Klaus";10.1126/sciadv.aav3991;;https://figshare.com/projects/Probabilistic_meaning_in_titi_monkeys_alarm:call_sequences/30488;figshare;Titi monkeys combine alarm calls to create probabilistic meaning;18369714-CE5A-42D6-A65F-CF10757603D9;166458
"Animals have evolved a range of communicative behaviours in the presence of danger. Although the mechanisms and functions of some of these behaviours have been relatively well researched, comparatively little is known about their ontogeny, including how animals learn to inform social partners about impending danger. In adult chimpanzees, behaviours in response to dangers involve several channels, particularly alarm calls and simultaneous gaze alternations with nearby recipients. Gaze alternations may allow inexperienced individuals to learn from more experienced ones by assessing their reactions to unfamiliar objects or events, but they may also provide the basis for more advanced social referencing. Here, we were interested in the development of these two common behaviours, alarm calling and gaze alternations, in wild chimpanzees (<em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic"">Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii</em>) confronted with a threat. Using a cross-sectional design, we investigated those in 8 infant and 8 juveniles by experimentally exposing them to an unfamiliar but potentially dangerous object, a large, remotely controlled, moving spider model. For alarm calling, we found a positive relation with age, starting at around 28 months, although alarm calls were not consistently emitted until after 80 months. For gaze alternations, we found no age effect, with some of the youngest infants already showing the behaviour. Although its function remains unclear in infant and juvenile chimpanzees, gaze alternations emerge early in chimpanzee development. Alarm calling may require more advanced developmental stages, such as greater perceptual abilities, categorical capacities or more sophisticated social cognition, i.e. an understanding that danger is a collective experience that requires communication.";"Crockford, Catherine; Dezecache, Guillaume; Zuberbuhler, Klaus";https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-019-2716-6;2019-01-26T00:00:00Z;https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/18057/Dezecache_2019_BES_alarmcontexts_CC.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y;PURE St Andrews;The development of communication in alarm contexts in wild chimpanzees;DA241876-7D8E-454B-B8B1-71DF0A237C86;166458

In the present study an ethnically representative sample of Swiss children at the ages of 2-, 3-, and 4-years (Mage = 3 years, N = 290 [150 male]) participated in a selective social learning task to assess (1) their flexibility in learning across the domains of language and action (trait reasoning), and (2) the influence of overt visual attention towards learning instances, while (3) reducing the strength of displayed incompetency to increase ecological validity. Children showed better word learning, but not better action imitation, from a competent than from an incompetent informant. However, there was neither evidence of trait reasoning nor evidence of overt attention differing between groups. Results are discussed in relation to social learning and ecological validity.;"Brehm, Julia; Daum, Moritz M.; Gampe, Anja";https://osf.io/u7qnk/?view_only=d9328f2643da4f0f9dcaae5f86bd601a;;https://osf.io/u7qnk/?view_only=d9328f2643da4f0f9dcaae5f86bd601a;OSF;Overt Attention in Selective Social Learning;561FE72C-62DE-4C0C-83A9-FEF364E093C9;162693

CD8 T cells are the main effectors of the adaptive immune response against intracellular pathogens and cancer. Chronic antigen stimulation and inflammation lead to CD8 T cell differentiation and function that differ from those generated during acute infections. A comprehensive definition of the heterogeneity existing within both tumor-specific and total CD8 tumor-infiltrating T cells remains to be clearly established. To investigate this heterogeneity at the transcriptomic level, we performed paired single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of >3500 CD8 T cells infiltrating B16 murine melanoma tumors, including cells of known tumor-specificity.;"Carmona, Santiago; Gfeller, David";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116390;2019-10-10T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116390;Gene Expression Omnibus;Gene expression data;461B338B-8649-4E39-AE2C-306AA1209C33;173156

Gene drive systems can lead to the evolution of traits that further enhance the transmission of the driving element. In gene drive, one allele is transmitted to offspring at a higher frequency than the homologous allele. This has a range of consequences, which generally include a reduction in fitness of the carrier of the driving allele, making such systems selfish. The t haplotype is one such driver, found in house mice. It is linked to a reduction in litter size in matings among heterozygous animals, but also to increased lifespan in wild females that carry it. Here, we tested whether carrying the t haplotype was associated with altered resting metabolic rate (RMR). We show that females carrying the t haplotype decrease RMR as they increase in size, compared to wildtype females or males of either genotype. Our study elucidates a plausible mechanism by which a selfish genetic element increases lifespan.;"Lindholm, Anna; Lopes, Patricia";10.5061/dryad.k71rd89;2019-12-17T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.k71rd89;Dryad;A selfish genetic element linked to increased lifespan impacts metabolism in female house mice;A9E7D3AF-773D-44AB-9FDB-25A9F4058175;160328

Adaptive radiations represent some of the most remarkable explosions of diversification across the tree of life. However, the constraints to rapid diversification and how they are sometimes overcome, particularly the relative roles of genetic architecture and hybridization, remain unclear. Here, we address these questions in the Alpine whitefish radiation, using a whole-genome dataset that includes multiple individuals of each of the 22 species belonging to six ecologically distinct ecomorph classes across several lake-systems. We reveal that repeated ecological and morphological diversification along a common environmental axis is associated with both genome-wide allele frequency shifts and a specific, larger effect, locus, associated with the gene edar. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of introgression between species from different lake-systems in facilitating the evolution and persistence of species with unique trait combinations and ecology. These results highlight the importance of both genome architecture and secondary contact with hybridization in fuelling adaptive radiation.;Feulner, Philine;https://doi.org/10.25678/0005S0;2021-02-21T00:00:00Z;https://opendata.eawag.ch/dataset/whitefish-radiation;eawag research data institutional collection;Data for: Genomic architecture of adaptive radiation and hybridization in Alpine whitefish;DBB578D9-E5A6-4DD6-8E18-046149CA1CB3;163446

You can find the instructions in the README.pdf file.If you are interested in building on top of our research results, you can find the latest version of Prusti in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev.AbstractRust's type system ensures memory safety: well-typed Rust programs are guaranteed to not exhibit problems such as dangling pointers, data races, and unexpected side effects through aliased references. Ensuring correctness properties beyond memory safety, for instance, the guaranteed absence of assertion failures or more-general functional correctness, requires static program verification. For traditional system programming languages, formal verification is notoriously difficult and requires complex specifications and logics to reason about pointers, aliasing, and side effects on mutable state. This complexity is a major obstacle to the more-widespread verification of system software.In this paper, we present a novel verification technique that leverages Rust's type system to greatly simplify the specification and verification of system software written in Rust. We analyse information from the Rust compiler and synthesise a corresponding core proof for the program in a flavour of separation logic tailored to automation. To verify correctness properties beyond memory safety, users can annotate Rust programs with specifications at the abstraction level of Rust expressions; our technique weaves them into the core proof to verify modularly whether these specifications hold. Crucially, our proofs are constructed and checked automatically without exposing the underlying formal logic, allowing users to work exclusively at the level of abstraction of the programming language. As such, our work enables a new kind of verification tool, with the potential to impact a wide audience and allow the Rust community to benefit from state-of-the-art verification techniques. We have implemented our techniques for a subset of Rust; our evaluation on several thousand functions from widely-used Rust crates demonstrates its effectiveness.";"Astrauskas, Vytautas; Müller, Peter; Poli, Federico; Summers, Alexander J.";" https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3363914";2019-08-15T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3363914;Zenodo;"Software Artefact for the OOPSLA'19 Paper Titled ""Leveraging Rust Types for Modular Specification and Verification""";986CFBBB-69E7-4979-BF96-9A3F24BFFF22;169503

To characterize the host response to pandemic IAV infection in its natural target cells, we infected primary human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures with wild-type pandemic IAV (WT) or a NS1 mutant virus (NS1R38A) with abrogated dsRNA binding capacity at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.03. We then profiled the transcriptomes of uninfected cells as well as cells harvested 18 hours post-infection (hpi) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).;Dijkman, Ronald;PRJEB56141;2022-09-20T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB56141;European Nucleotide Archive;Whole genome sequencing of Recombinant influenza A viruses;834C47BB-55F0-41DC-A5BD-9DF9D7863C90;179260

The maintenance of items in working memory relies on persistent neural activity in a widespread network of brain areas. To investigate the influence of load on working memory, we asked human subjects to maintain sets of letters in memory while we recorded single neurons and intracranial encephalography (EEG) in the medial temporal lobe and scalp EEG. Along the periods of a trial, hippocampal neural firing differentiated between success and error trials during stimulus encoding, predicted workload during memory maintenance, and predicted the subjects’ behavior during retrieval. During maintenance, neuronal firing was synchronized with intracranial hippocampal EEG. On the network level, synchronization between hippocampal and scalp EEG in the theta-alpha frequency range showed workload dependent oscillatory coupling between hippocampus and cortex. Thus, we found that persistent neural activity in the hippocampus participated in working memory processing that is specific to memory maintenance, load sensitive and synchronized to the cortex.

Stimuli were presented in a block design. The paradigm consisted of eight activation and eight baseline blocks each lasting 24 seconds. The activation condition consisted of 75 brief episodes (2 to 3 seconds) from thriller and horror films. All episodes showed the faces of actors who were expressing fear with high intensity. None of the episodes showed violence or aggression. Quality and applicability of film sequences were evaluated by an expert panel consisting of nine psychologists. Of an initial collection of 120 scenes, only sequences that were considered appropriate by the majority of the expert panel were extracted for the paradigm. Evaluation criteria were as follows: 1) actor’s face is clearly visible; 2) emotion displayed is clearly recognizable as fear; 3) fear is the only clearly recognizable emotion (no other emotion, e.g., anger, sadness, surprise, is displayed); and (4) the fear displayed is of high intensity. During baseline blocks, 72 short episodes of similar length (2 to 3 seconds) with dynamic landscape video recordings were presented. Video clips of dull domestic landscapes were used owing to their stable low emotional content while their general visual stimulus properties were comparable with the movie clips.

Hydra possesses three distinct stem cell populations that continuously self-renew and prevent aging in Hydra vulgaris. However sexual animals from the H. oligactis cold-sensitive (Ho_CS) strain develop an aging phenotype upon gametogenesis induction, initiated by the loss of interstitial stem cells. Animals stop regenerating, lose their active behaviors and die within three months. This phenotype is not observed in the cold-resistant Ho_CR strain. To dissect the mechanisms of Hydra aging, we compared the self-renewal of epithelial stem cells in these two strains and found it irreversibly reduced in aging Ho_CS while sustained in non-aging Ho_CR. We also identified a deficient autophagy in Ho_CS epithelial cells, with a constitutive deficiency in autophagosome formation as detected with the mCherry-eGFP-LC3A/B autophagy sensor, an inefficient response to starvation as evidenced by the accumulation of the autophagosome cargo protein p62/SQSTM1, and a poorly-inducible autophagy flux upon proteasome inhibition. In the non-aging H. vulgaris animals, the blockade of autophagy by knocking-down WIPI2 suffices to induce aging. This study highlights the essential role of a dynamic autophagy flux to maintain epithelial stem cell renewal and prevent aging.;"Galliot, Brigitte; Schenkelaars, Quentin; Tomczyk, Szymon; Wenger, Yvan";Hydratlas.unige.ch;2020-01-23T00:00:00Z;https://hydratlas.unige.ch/blast/datasets/normacounts_CR2017.csv.gz;Hydratlas;Transcriptomic RNA-seq dataset from the non-aging cold-resistant strain of Hydra oligactis;A6D7BC7F-EE78-4416-AB67-2ACEB7FE5528;169930

"The manuscript includes experimental work and computational analysis from several groups, including proteomic and proteogenomic analyses from my group (reflected by my status as corresponing author). For our contribution, we re-analyzed proteomic data we had helped to analyze and deposit in public repositories before: data from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (now Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens) USDA 110 grown in rich (PSY) and minimal medium (PXD000487), and data on protein expression of B. japonicum in symbiosis with soybean root nodules (PRD000813), cowpea and siratro root nodules (PRD0766).During the symbiosis with legumes, Bradyrhizobium japonicum cells infect roots where they induce the formation of root nodules and differentiate into intracellular nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. We used differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq; data provided by K. Förstner) for the genome-wide detection of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) in B. japonicum USDA 110 cells grown free-living or as bacteroids in soybean root nodules.A newly developed TSS recognition procedure based on machine learning allowed us to map 15,923 TSSs: 14,360 in free-living bacteria, 4,329 in bacteroids and 2,766 in both living conditions. Using a proteogenomics approach (re-analysis of public protein datasets ), we provide evidence for the translation of 107 new transcripts including 14 with TSSs in annotated genes. In addition, we provide evidence for 178 shorter or longer proteins, 109 of them with TSS support (Data provided by U. Omasits, C.H. Ahrens, Additional file 7 (Table S5, S6)). Based on our TSS map and a new de novo promoter prediction algorithm, we identified promoter motifs mainly used in nodules (similar to RpoN-dependent promoters) or under both conditions (similar to RpoD-dependent promoters). The data is made available in a generic feature format (GFF) file along with an updated and extended genome annotation comprising promoters, TSSs and terminators (Additional files 5 and 6). The value of such a TSS and promoter map beyond the identification of novel transcripts and ORFs is illustrated by the experimental analysis of an antisense RNA, which is a by-product of transcriptional interference in a gene encoding a cytochrome P450 highly expressed in nodules.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE69059 (Download link, incl. metadata)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP058513 (Data available in the NCBI short read archive (SRA))";"Ahrens, Christian; Förstner, Konrad; Omasits, Ulrich";GSE69059;2016-04-18T00:00:00Z;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69059

Insect herbivory is an important process in terrestrial ecosystems, which can be affected by land-use intensification through changes in either the community composition of herbivorous insects (structure and function), the plant community composition (structure and function) or the trophic interactions between insects and plants. Based on vegetation records from the previous year, we assessed insect herbivory on the most abundant plant species on all forest and grassland plots in all three regions. Leaf material was sampled in 2017 and 2018. On a random sample of leaves, we visually estimated the area damaged by herbivorous insects and gall mites (distinguished into different damage types) and measured leaf area using a leaf area meter.;"Gossner, Martin; Neff, Felix; Prati, Daniel";BExIS ID 24806;2019-03-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/ddm/data/Showdata/24806;BExIS;Plant-species specific assessment of invertebrate herbivory on all EPs, 2017/2018;642E5074-6075-4284-A8A2-C83F33080713;173542

The genetic basis of parallel evolution of similar species is of great interest in evolutionary biology. In the adaptive radiation of Lake Victoria cichlid fishes, sister species with either blue or red-back male nuptial coloration have evolved repeatedly, often associated with shallower and deeper water, respectively. One such case are blue and red-backed Pundamilia species, for which we recently showed that a young species pair may have evolved through “hybrid parallel speciation”. Coalescent simulations suggested that the older species P. pundamilia (blue) and P. nyererei (red-back) admixed in the Mwanza Gulf and that new “nyererei-like” and “pundamilia-like” species evolved from the admixed population. Here, we use genome scans to study the genomic architecture of differentiation, and assess the influence of hybridization on the evolution of the younger species pair. For each of the two species pairs, we find over 300 genomic regions, widespread across the genome, which are highly differentiated. A subset of the most strongly differentiated regions of the older pair are also differentiated in the younger pair. These shared differentiated regions often show parallel allele frequency differences, consistent with the hypothesis that admixture-derived alleles were targeted by divergent selection in the hybrid population. However, two thirds of the genomic regions that are highly differentiated between the younger species are not highly differentiated between the older species, suggesting independent evolutionary responses to selection pressures. Our analyses reveal how divergent selection on admixture-derived genetic variation can facilitate new speciation events.;Meier, Joana;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8p6m07g;2019-03-19T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8p6m07g;Dryad;Data from: Genomics of parallel ecological speciation in Lake Victoria cichlids;F474544F-44EB-4FBA-AD30-C3B77744C07F;163338

In recent years resulting investigations in living microbialites have provided significant data that have been critical to disentangle the role of the various biotic and abiotic processes contributing to their development. Despite these efforts separating the impact and magnitude of these processes remain a difficult task. At present the Maquinchao Basin in northeastern Patagonia, Argentina, contains both fossil and living microbialites. Thus, the region provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters in carbonate precipitation. Early investigations (Austral summer 2011) in living microbialites concluded that organomineralization was related to both photosynthetic activity in the more surficial layer (green), and sulfate-reduction in the lower part (beige). Field investigations in the same area four years later showed that the pounds previously containing abundant active mats had dried out, and in general revealed the absence of globular structured clusters of minerals in the microbial mats. Here we present microscale investigations using optical microscopy and SEM along with the 16SrRNA gene sequence diversity, and the physico-chemical parameters of the hosting waters. They were carried out in successive seasonal samplings in November 2015, April-May 2016, August 2016, February 2017, and March 2018. All microbialite samples show regular occurrences of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) along with filaments of unknown origin. Carbonates are observed associated with erect filaments in shallow and active running water locations whereas the mineral phase is located below organic matter film in comparatively deeper and calmer water areas. Additionally, seasonal changes in the physico-chemical properties of the hosting waters indicate that extrinsic parameters, especially evaporation, might play a more substantial role in the precipitation of these carbonates than previously proposed. The environmental differences between 2011 and 2015 in meteorological conditions, regional volcanic activity and associated deposits in the basin are analyzed. We concluded that they are likely responsible of the decrease of the mineralization processes, and particularly those associated with photosynthetic activity.  These results call for caution when interpreting the degree of biological impact on the formation of microbialites in the geological record. Local extrinsic factors might have a changeable impact over time switching mineral precipitation from biotic to abiotic and vice-versa, which can be undistinguishable in fossilized microbialites.;Eymard, Inès;https://lajsba.sedimentologia.org.ar/index.php/lajsba/article/view/28-2-4;2021-12-27T00:00:00Z;https://lajsba.sedimentologia.org.ar/index.php/lajsba/article/view/28-2-4;"NCBI Genbank ";Evolving controls on mineralization in Patagonian microbial mats as inferred by water chemistry, microscopy and DNA signatures;05512269-36BA-46F4-AA82-263F219125EF;188571

"Data and R Code for the manuscript ""Exploring the Influence of Goals at Different Levels of Abstraction on Self-Reported and Electronically Measured Exercise Frequency: An Experimental Field Study"".Although regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits, many people are not sufficiently active. Interventions that aim to increase physical activity rely mainly on concrete, “subordinate” goals. Based on a goal-theoretical perspective, I argue that combining goals at different levels of abstraction may foster successful goal pursuit, particularly in the long run. In the present study, all participants committed to the subordinate goal of exercising three times per week for three weeks. A 2 × 2 between-subjects design was used to assign participants to an additional superordinate goal, concrete action steps, or both; a control group focused solely on the subordinate goal. The main outcome was exercise frequency, which was measured (a) in the short term, i.e., during the three-week intervention period, using self-reports and electronic data; and (b) in the long term, i.e., during a six-month follow-up period, using electronic data. For the self-reported frequency in the short term, the results show an interaction between a superordinate goal and action steps: In the absence of action steps, a superordinate goal had a negative effect, but this negative effect dissolved when action steps were present. Similarly, action steps exerted a positive effect in the presence of a superordinate goal, but this effect dissolved in the absence of a superordinate goal. When considering goal achievement (i.e., nine completed training sessions), the beneficial effect of a combination of superordinate goals and action steps and detrimental effect of focusing only on a superordinate goal or action steps was even more pronounced. Goal manipulation had no significant influence either in the short or long term for electronically measured exercise frequency. Possible explanations for the observed effects and the differences between self-reported and electronically measured exercise frequencies are discussed.

Lacustrine sediments are widely used to investigate the impact of climatic change on biogeochemical cycling. In these sediments, subsurface microbial communities are major actors of this cycling but can also affect the sedimentary record and overprint the original paleoenvironmental signal. We therefore investigated the subsurface microbial communities of the oldest lake in Europe, Lake Ohrid (North Macedonia, Albania), to assess the potential connection between microbial diversity and past environmental change using 16S rRNA gene sequences. Along the upper ca. 200 m of the DEEP site sediment record spanning ca. 515 thousand years (ka), our results show that Atribacteria, Bathyarchaeia and Gammaproteobacteria structured the community independently from each other. Except for the latter, these taxa are common in deep lacustrine and marine sediments due to their metabolic versatility adapted to low energy environments. Gammaproteobacteria were often co-occurring with cyanobacterial sequences or soil-related OTUs suggesting preservation of ancient DNA from the water column or catchment back to at least 340 ka, particularly in dry glacial intervals. We found significant environmental parameters influencing the overall microbial community distribution, but no strong relationship with given phylotypes and paleoclimatic signals or sediment age. Our results support a weak recording of early diagenetic processes and their actors by bulk prokaryotic sedimentary DNA in Lake Ohrid, replaced by specialized low-energy clades of the deep biosphere and a marked imprint of erosional processes on the subsurface DNA pool of Lake Ohrid.;"Ariztegui, Daniel; Francke, Alexander; Thomas, Camille; Vogel, Hendrik; Wagner, Bernd";https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/11/1736/s1;2020-11-05T00:00:00Z;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/11/1736/s1;NCBI Genbank (MT066494–MT067558);Weak Influence of Paleoenvironmental Conditions on the Subsurface Biosphere of Lake Ohrid over the Last 515 ka;327C6E6E-9A64-47D1-A84F-98D3E7A4B402;188571

Despite effective treatment, HIV can persist in latent reservoirs, which represent a major obstacle towards HIV eradication. Targeting and reactivating latent cells is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of HIV infected cells. Here, we used a primary model of HIV latency and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity during HIV latency and reactivation. Our analysis identified transcriptional programs leading to successful reactivation of HIV expression. We further validated our results using primary CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV+ individuals.;Golumbeanu, Monica;GSE111727;2018-03-13T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111727;NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);Single-cell RNA-Seq data and bulk RNA-Seq data;AE47C03C-327D-4DBA-A194-42D2D4493D2F;166412

In this work, we identify the importance of C-60 and compact-TiO2 (cTiO(2)) as electron transport layers on the device performance of coevaporated n-i-p perovskite solar cells. We found (1) a synergetic effect between both layers when extracting the charges and (2) that optimization of the C-60 layer is essential for obtaining devices with enhanced device performance. In particular, we found that a C-60 layer of an optimum thickness (<15 nm) enhances the charge extraction when employed in a coevaporated perovskite solar cell. With thicker C-60 layers (>20 nm), an additional charge transport resistance is observed by impedance analysis, indicating that devices with nonoptimized C-60 thickness could limit the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells.;"Alvarez, Agustin O.; Fabregat-Santiago, Francisco; Igci, Cansu; Kanda, Hiroyuki; Klipfel, Nadja; Momblona, Cristina; Nazeeruddin, Mohammad Khaja; Roldán-Carmona, Cristina; Sutanto, Albertus Adrian";DOI 10.1021/acsaem.1c03060;2022-02-28T00:00:00Z;https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/292003;Infoscience;C 60 Thin Films in Perovskite Solar Cells: Efficient or Limiting Charge Transport Layer?;47A8CE52-9F29-481B-98FE-7EFECAF3AC79;186390

To attain commercial viability, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have to be reasonably priced, highly efficient, and stable for a long period of time. Although a new record of a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) value over 25% was achieved, PSC performance is limited by the lack of hole-transporting materials (HTMs), which extract positive charges from the light-absorbing perovskite layer and carry them to the electrode. Here, we report spirobifluorene-based HTMs with finely tuned energy levels, high glass-transition temperature, and excellent charge mobility and conductivity enabled by molecularly engineered enamine arms. HTMs are synthesized using simple condensation chemistry, which does not require costly catalysts, inert reaction conditions, and time-consuming product purification procedures. Enamine-derived HTMs allow the fabrication of PSCs reaching a maximum PCE of 19.2% and stability comparable to spiro-OMeTAD. This work demonstrates that simple enamine condensation reactions could be used as a universal path to obtain HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.;"Asiri, Abdullah M.; Ding, Bin; Dyson, Paul J.; Getautis, Vytautas; Gruodis, Alytis; Igci, Cansu; Jankauskas, Vygintas; Malinauskas, Tadas; Momblona, Cristina; Nazeeruddin, Mohammad Khaja; Rakstys, Kasparas; Sutanto, Albertus Adrian; Vaitukaityte, Deimante";" 10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c01486";2021-08-10T00:00:00Z;https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/288113;Infoscience;Cut from the Same Cloth: Enamine-Derived Spirobifluorenes as Hole Transporters for Perovskite Solar Cells;9D9B535B-3F80-4084-8426-3F67AEAC0308;186390

During a 2018 field campaign on Rhonegletscher, several hot water boreholes were drilled in order to provide direct observations into an active englacial conduit network. The presented video shows the borehole camera being lowered into the active englacial conduit. The camera is initially lowered into murky water before reaching the active conduit. Whilst positioned in the conduit the camera is violently shaken, as a result of flowing englacial water, and sediment is being transported along the base.;Church, Greg;10.3929/ethz-b-000406689;;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000406689;ETH Zurich Research Collection;Borehole Camera Video of Englacial Conduit;9442830D-4FF2-4F79-9BA5-7EF041C1ED53;169329
Clustering is a technique to analyze empirical data, with a major application for biomedical research. Essentially, clustering finds groups of related points in a dataset. However, results depend on both metrics for point-to-point similarity and rules for point-to-group association. Non-appropriate metrics and rules can lead to artifacts, especially in case of multiple groups with heterogeneous structure. In this work, we propose a clustering algorithm that evaluates the properties of paths between points (rather than point-to-point similarity) and solves a global optimization problem, finding solutions not obtainable by methods relying on local choices. Moreover, our algorithm is trainable. Hence, it can be adapted and adopted for specific datasets and applications by providing examples of valid and invalid paths to train a path classifier. We demonstrate its applicability to identify heterogeneous groups in challenging synthetic datasets, segment highly nonconvex immune cells in confocal microscopy images, and classify arrhythmic heartbeats in electrocardiographic signals.;"Gonzalez, Santiago Fernandez; Krause, Rolf; Pizzagalli, Diego Ulisse";10.1126/sciadv.aax3770;2019-10-30T00:00:00Z;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2019/10/25/5.10.eaax3770.DC1;Sciences advances - supplementary materials;A trainable clustering algorithm based on shortest paths from density peaks;3A0D75FD-AF5D-413C-9376-C1187441329B;176124

Leaf-inhabiting fungal and bacterial endophytes are at their most diverse in tropical rainforest plant hosts, with some influencing host plant fitness as either symbionts or pathogens. Endophyte activity and community composition is thought to depend on competition amongst co-occurring species for resources. Here, we reveal the strength of competitive interactions between endophytes by combining e-DNA metabarcoding to characterize the community with culturing assays to ascertain their potential activity. The endophyte community associated with the understory palm Astrocaryum sciophilum was determined by extracting eDNA from 120 leaflets of eight plants located in a lowland rainforest in French Guiana. This revealed 516 fungal and 606 bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Co-occurrence analysis of the most abundant OTUs revealed that direct fungal-fungal interactions were overall more negative than bacterial-bacterial interactions. This was confirmed by C-score calculations for the whole endophyte community, revealing significantly greater levels of species segregation for fungi but not bacteria when compared with simulated random communities. Following the culturing of 131 fungal, and 66 bacterial Astrocaryum endophytes collected from the same leaves, Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations of ethyl acetate culture extracts were evaluated against the fungus Trichophyton rubrum and the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.  Overall, a minority of extracts demonstrated antipathogen activity, with greater antifungal activity expression for both fungi and bacteria when compared with antibacterial activity. In order to explore whether this activity translated into competitive structuring of the community, a BLAST was conducted to match metabarcoding sequences with Sanger derived culture sequences. This demonstrated that cultures displaying antipathogen activity were significantly more likely to co-occur with fungi if they were bacteria, and bacteria if they were fungi. Nevertheless, overall correlation values averaged around zero. These results indicate that for Astrocaryum palms, fungal endophytes are likely to play a greater role in determining colonization success of subsequent endophytes whether these be fungal or bacterial, but that overall endophyte communities do not display strong patterns of community structuring through competition. Endophyte communities are thus likely to reach relative stasis in mature leaves, where the diverse community of fungi and bacteria amongst other factors prevent the subsequent establishment of pathogens.;Donald, Julian;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jsxksn055;2020-01-10T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jsxksn055;DRYAS;Tropical palm endophytes exhibit low competitive structuring when assessed using co-occurrence and antipathogen activity analysi;E32C2925-09A5-42C3-B372-A42DD34F6AC6;164289

In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes encase axons with myelin, a highly organized multilayered membrane structure. Myelin allows the rapid propagation of action potentials along the axons, while also supporting their mantainance metabolically. Fatty acids are basic building blocks for both glyco- and phospholipids, key constituents of cell membranes. Moreover, fatty acids can modify proteins via palmitoylation and activate transcriptional networks, e.g. through the PPARs transcription factors. Due to the high demand of membrane oligodendrocytes face to produce myelin, we hypothesized that they strongly rely upon fatty acid synthesis rather than mostly on their intake from the dietary pool. We tested this hypothesis by deleting the enzyme Fatty Acid Synthase specifically from neonatal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, in vivo in C57Bl/6 olig2Cre FASN floxed mice. We addressed the consequences of this depletion on oligodendrocytes differentation and myelination potential in the central nervous system. In particular, we analyzed by RNA-seq how lack of FASN affected the transcriptome of optic nerves dissected from P14 mutant (olig2Cre FASN lox/lox) versus control (FASN lox/lox) mice.;"Montani, Laura; Suter, Ueli";GSE112725;2019-05-03T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112725;GEO;Role of fatty acid synthase in oligodendrocyte myelination;90BD94ED-33D8-4E15-94A0-892C8963E09C;173078
"We addressed the requirement of DGCR8, DROSHA and DICER functions in developing and adult Schwann cells (SCs) using mouse mutants. We found that the microprocessor components DGCR8 and DROSHA are crucial for axonal radial sorting and to establish correct SC numbers upon myelination. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the microprocessor is essential to prevent aberrant accumulation and de novo expression of injury-response genes. Those genes are predicted targets of stage-specifically enriched miRNAs. In agreement, DGCR8 and DICER are required for proper maintenance of the myelinated SC state. We conclude that the miRNA pathway is crucial for preventing inappropriate activity of injury response genes in developing and adult SCs.

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Bile acids control lipid homeostasis by regulating uptake from food and excretion. Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity. In conclusion, the established LC-MS/MS method enables uncomplicated sample preparation and quantification of key bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue of human and rodent species to facilitate future studies of disease mechanisms and drug-induced liver injury.;"Bouitbir, Jamal; Gómez, Cristina; Kratschmar, Denise V; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon";10.5281/zenodo.4528982;2020-07-09T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4528982;Zenodo;Data_Figure2_Development and Validation of a Highly Sensitive LC-MS/MS Method for the Analysis of Bile Acids in Serum, Plasma, and Liver Tissue Samples;C7B4263F-6C4C-4FF3-AFBF-86A9521CA6EC;179400

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

AbstractWe theoretically and experimentally examine the effect of forcing and damping on systems that can be described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), by making use of the phase-space predictions of the three-wave truncation. In the latter, the spectrum is truncated to only the fundamental frequency and the upper and lower sidebands. Our experiments are performed on deep water waves, which are better described by the higher-order NLSE, the Dysthe equation. We therefore extend our analysis to this system. However, our conclusions are general for NLSE systems. By means of experimentally obtained phase-space trajectories, we demonstrate that forcing and damping cause a separatrix crossing during the evolution. When the system is damped, it is pulled outside the separatrix, which in the real space corresponds to a phase-shift of the envelope and therefore doubles the period of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou recurrence cycle. When the system is forced by the wind, it is pulled inside the separatrix, lifting the phase-shift. Furthermore, we observe a growth and decay cycle for modulated plane waves that are conventionally considered stable. Finally, we give a theoretical demonstration that forcing the NLSE system can induce symmetry breaking during the evolution.;"Armaroli, A.; Branger, H.; Brunetti, M.; Eeltink, D.; Kasparian, J.; Luneau, C.";doi:10.1007/s11071-020-06043-1;2020-12-29T00:00:00Z;https://yareta.unige.ch/#/home/detail/8841c6e4-3e3a-4f42-b3bd-3369fd7942f8;Yareta;Separatrix crossing and symmetry breaking in NLSE-like systems due to forcing and damping;54653888-A627-4451-8D7B-D2E338004199;175697

Echinococcus multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a rising zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere. Treatment of this fatal disease is limited to chemotherapy using benzimidazoles and surgical intervention, with frequent disease recurrence in cases without radical surgery. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying E. multilocularis infections and host-parasite interactions ultimately aids developing novel therapeutic options. This study explored an involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS) during E. multilocularis infection in mice.E. multilocularis- and mock-infected C57BL/6 mice were subdivided into vehicle, albendazole (ABZ) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (αPD-L1) treated groups. To mimic a chronic infection, treatments of mice started six weeks post i.p. infection and continued for another eight weeks. Liver tissue was then collected to examine inflammatory cytokines and the expression of UPR- and ERS-related genes.E. multilocularis infection led to an upregulation of UPR- and ERS-related proteins in the liver, including ATF6, CHOP, GRP78, ERp72, H6PD and calreticulin, whilst PERK and its target eIF2α were not affected, and IRE1α and ATF4 were downregulated. ABZ treatment in E. multilocularis infected mice reversed, or at least tended to reverse, these protein expression changes to levels seen in mock-infected mice. Furthermore, ABZ treatment reversed the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ in the liver of infected mice. Similar to ABZ, αPD-L1 immune-treatment tended to reverse the increased CHOP and decreased ATF4 and IRE1α expression levels.AE caused chronic inflammation, UPR activation and ERS in mice. The E. multilocularis-induced inflammation and consecutive ERS was ameliorated by ABZ and αPD-L1 treatment, indicating their effectiveness to inhibit parasite proliferation and downregulate its activity status. Neither ABZ nor αPD-L1 themselves affected UPR in control mice. Further research is needed to elucidate the link between inflammation, UPR and ERS, and if these pathways offer potential for improved therapies of patients with AE.;"Beldi, Guido; Gottstein, Bruno; Jebbawi, Fadi; Lundström-Stadelmann, Britta; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon; Wang, Junhua; Weingartner, Michael";10.5281/zenodo.5838151;2022-03-03T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5838151;zenodo;Data_Supplemental_Fig1_Albendazole reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by Echinococcus multilocularis in mice;CFB3BC2E-4D31-4091-B9A1-2BE67562FAD4;179400
Connecting the selective forces that drive the evolution of phenotypes to their underlying genotypes is key to understanding adaptation, but such connections are rarely tested experimentally. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are a powerful model for such tests because genotypes that underlie putatively adaptive traits have been identified. For example, a regulatory mutation in the Ectodysplasin (Eda) gene causes a reduction in the number of bony armor plates, which occurs rapidly and repeatedly when marine sticklebacks invade freshwater. However, the source of selection on plate loss in freshwater is unknown. Here, we tested whether dietary reduction of phosphorus can account for selection on plate loss due to a growth advantage of low-plated fish in freshwater. We crossed marine fish heterozygous for the 16 kilobase freshwater Eda haplotype and compared the growth of offspring with different genotypes under contrasting levels of dietary phosphorus in both saltwater and freshwater. Eda genotype was not associated with growth differences in any treatment, or with mechanisms that could mitigate the impacts of phosphorus limitation, like differential phosphorus deposition, phosphorus excretion, or intestine length. This study highlights the importance of experimentally testing the putative selective forces acting on phenotypes and their underlying genotypes in the wild.;Archambeault, Sophie;https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9409-7541;2020-10-13T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.stqjq2c1d;Dryad;Data from: Phosphorus limitation does not drive loss of bony lateral plates in freshwater stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus);4E26446F-C692-4894-8605-C6BC9748DFEF;175614

Worldwide, reservoirs are subjected to sedimentation due to inflowing sediment. The continuous sediment accumulation negatively affects the sustainable use of single- and multi-purpose reservoirs. Sediment Bypass Tunnels (SBTs) are effective and sustainable countermeasures. They route the incoming sediment-laden flow around the dam to reduce or totally prevent reservoir sedimentation and provide sediment continuity. Due to the high sediment transport rates combined with high flow velocities, severe hydro-abrasion may occur at the SBT inverts. Similar hydro-abrasion mechanisms also occur at other hydraulic structures such as low-level outlets, sediment sluicing tunnels and channels, weirs and stilling basins, and in steep bedrock rivers and mountain torrents. Hydroabrasion poses serious problems for the sustainable use of hydraulic structures since it puts the structural and operational safety at a risk and causes high maintenance costs.  This study aimed to advance the understanding of the abrasion mechanics and to develop a predictive, mechanistic hydro-abrasion model for both the design of sustainable hydraulic structures, and for better prediction of river & landscape evolution. The investigation is based on systematic laboratory tests and data collected from previous laboratory and recent field studies. To achieve the study goals, five research tasks were established, in which the following was experimentally investigated: (i) mean and turbulent flow characteristics in supercritical narrow open-channel flows (Task A), (ii) single particle motion (Task B), (iii) hydro abrasion depth and pattern in various flow conditions using different bed lining materials and particles (Task C). Tasks A to C were devoted to (iv) the development of a realistic-mechanistic hydro-abrasion model to predict the abrasion both in the field and at laboratory scale (Task D), and (v) recommendations for engineering application of the model (Task E). The experiments were conducted in supercritical narrow open channel flows with Froude numbers in a range of 2 ≤ Fo ≤ 5, and low width-to-depth aspect ratios 1 ≤ b/ho ≤ 4.44. In the Task C experiments, erodible foams and low-strength mortar mixtures were used to obtain measurable abrasion rates within a reasonable time. This study particularly focused on the effect of particle and bed lining material hardness, bed cover and low aspect ratio on hydro-abrasion, which were not studied and interlinked in previous studies. The Task A results show that four well-developed large scale streamwise vortex pairs are formed in the hydraulically smooth and planar bed conditions, i.e., in absence of any bed forms across the flume. Such secondary currents re-distribute the bed shear stress, thus affecting the cross-sectional distribution of sediment transport and hydro-abrasion patterns. In the Task B experiments, the particle transport mode, i.e., rolling, sliding and saltation, particle velocities, hop heights, and lengths were determined from the images recorded with a high-speed camera. The results show that the bed roughness is the key parameter affecting the particle saltation trajectories, while particle properties such as diameter and shape have a negligible effect. From the particle saltation trajectory data, nondimensional equations were developed and used in the abrasion prediction model.  The hydro-abrasion experiments (Task C) reveal that the abrasion pattern depends on the aspect ratio and bed lining material homogeneity. For the foam experiments at b/ho ≤ 2, the abrasion concentrates at the flume center forming a continuous incision channel, whereas two incision channels were formed near the flume sidewalls at b/ho = 4. This outcome shows that abrasion patterns observed in the foam tests match well with the bed shear stress distributions. In mortar experiments, potholes were formed instead of the incision channels due to the non-homogeneity of the cementitious material. The Task C experiments also show that increasing particle hardness causes higher abrasion rates. Furthermore, an exponential cover effect term is the best representative of the present data relating sediment transport to abrasion rates. In Task D, the experimental results from Task A−C were used to enhance the state-of-the art mechanistic hydro-abrasion model developed by Sklar and Dietrich (2004) by (i) replacing the original particle velocity and hop length formulae with the newly-developed equations, (ii) adding the exponential cover effect term to the model, and (iii) introducing two new terms that account for the particle hardness effect and particle saltation probability. The hydro-abrasion coefficient, kv of the enhanced abrasion model (SAMD) was calibrated by using the present data and the field data from Pfaffensprung, Runcahez, and Solis SBTs, and a constant kv = (5.0 ± 2.4) × 10^4 is proposed. The enhanced model was validated using independent data. The results show that SAMD predicts the hydroabrasion rates for various bed lining materials, i.e., natural bedrocks and concretes, within an error range between +92% and −33%, which is a significant improvement over previous abrasion prediction models. The enhanced model performs well and applies for both laboratory and field applications indicating that the laboratory findings can be upscaled to the prototype scale.  Recommendations for engineering application of the present findings are given in Task E. Overall, the present investigation contributes to the understanding of supercritical narrow  open channel flows, particle motion in such high-speed flows, and hydro-abrasion mechanics. Therefore, the present research outputs can be used for the improvement of algorithms in numerical predictive models such as for landscape evolution, 3D flow and sediment transport simulations. Furthermore, they will contribute to the layout and design of sustainable hydraulic structures prone to hydro-abrasion.;Demiral-Yüzügüllü, Dila;10.3929/ethz-b-000506311;2021-09-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/506311;ETH Zurich research-collection;PhD thesis;92B4E6DC-C805-45B2-92FF-CFAD46342079;166253
"The influence of species diversity on ecosystem functioning has been the subject of many experiments and remains a key question for ecology and conservation biology. However, the fact that diversity cannot be manipulated without affecting species composition makes this quest methodologically challenging. We used partial Mantel tests to evaluate the relative importance of diversity and of composition on biomass production. Here, we applied partial Mantel tests (controlling for the other variable) on two datasets, the Jena (2002-2008) and the Grandcour (2008-2009) Experiment. In both experiments, plots were sown with different numbers of species to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Contrary to Jena, plots were not mowed nor weeded in Grandcour, allowing external species to establish. Based on the diversity-ecosystem functioning and competition theories, we tested two predictions: 1) the contribution of composition should increase with time; 2) the contribution of composition should be more important in non-weeded than in controlled systems. We found support for the second hypothesis, but not for the first. On the contrary, the contribution of species richness became markedly more important few years after the start of the Jena Experiment. This result can be interpreted as species complementarity, rather than intraspecific competition, being the driving force in this system. Finally, we explored to what extent the estimated relative importance of both factors could vary when measured on different spatial scales of the experiment (in our case, increasing the number of plots included in the analyses). We found a strong effect of scale, suggesting that comparisons between studies, and more generally the extrapolation of results from experiments to natural situations, should be made with caution.";Sandau, Nadine;"10.5061/dryad.44bm6 ";2016-10-27T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.44bm6;Dryad;Data from: The relative contribution of species richness and species composition to ecosystem functioning;EEC7E3DD-B853-451B-8671-CB9024B48597;138489

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Bile acids control lipid homeostasis by regulating uptake from food and excretion. Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity. In conclusion, the established LC-MS/MS method enables uncomplicated sample preparation and quantification of key bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue of human and rodent species to facilitate future studies of disease mechanisms and drug-induced liver injury.;"Bouitbir, Jamal; Gómez, Cristina; Kratschmar, Denise V; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon";10.5281/zenodo.4529188;2020-07-09T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4529188;Zenodo;Data_Supplemental_Tab2_Development and Validation of a Highly Sensitive LC-MS/MS Method for the Analysis of Bile Acids in Serum, Plasma, and Liver Tissue Samples;3380B976-CB6D-4A14-8E6E-2FB262372EEF;179400

Transcriptional recording by CRISPR spacer acquisition from RNA endows engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic memory, which through Record-seq reveals transcriptome-scale records. Microbial sentinels that traverse the gastrointestinal tract capture a wide range of genes and pathways that describe interactions with the host, including quantitative shifts in the molecular environment that result from alterations in the host diet, induced inflammation, and microbiome complexity. We demonstrate multiplexed recording using barcoded CRISPR arrays, enabling the reconstruction of transcriptional histories of isogenic bacterial strains in vivo. Record-seq therefore provides a scalable, noninvasive platform for interrogating intestinal and microbial physiology throughout the length of the intestine without manipulations to host physiology and can determine how single microbial genetic differences alter the way in which the microbe adapts to the host intestinal environment.;"Conway, Tyrrell; Farouni, Rick; Macpherson, Andrew J.; Platt, Randall J.; Schmidt, Florian; Tanna, Tanmay; Zimmermann, Jakob";https://en.bio-protocol.org/cjrap.aspx?eid=10.1126/science.abm6038;2022-05-13T00:00:00Z;https://en.bio-protocol.org/cjrap.aspx?eid=10.1126/science.abm6038;Bioprotocols;Noninvasive assessment of gut function using transcriptional recording sentinel cells;5D05BDF3-51A6-48D2-A020-DAE94A241946;179479

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity.

AbstractBackgroundThe complex life cycle of malaria parasites requires well-orchestrated stage specific gene expression. In the vertebrate host the parasites grow and multiply by schizogony in two different environments: within erythrocytes and within hepatocytes. Whereas erythrocytic parasites are well-studied in this respect, relatively little is known about the exo-erythrocytic stages.Methods In an attempt to fill this gap, genome wide RNA-seq analyses of various exo-erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium berghei including sporozoites, samples from a time-course of liver stage development and detached cells were performed. These latter contain infectious merozoites and represent the final step in exo-erythrocytic development. Results The analysis represents the complete transcriptome of the entire life cycle of P. berghei parasites with temporal detailed analysis of the liver stage allowing comparison of gene expression across the progression of the life cycle. These RNA-seq data from different developmental stages were used to cluster genes with similar expression profiles, in order to infer their functions. A comparison with published data from other parasite stages confirmed stage-specific gene expression and revealed numerous genes that are expressed differentially in blood and exo-erythrocytic stages. One of the most exo-erythrocytic stage-specific genes was PBANKA_1003900, which has previously been annotated as a “gametocyte specific protein”. The promoter of this gene drove high GFP expression in exo-erythrocytic stages, confirming its expression profile seen by RNA-seq. Conclusions The comparative analysis of the genome wide mRNA expression profiles of erythrocytic and different exo-erythrocytic stages could be used to improve the understanding of gene regulation in Plasmodium parasites and can be used to model exo-erythrocytic stage metabolic networks toward the identification of differences in metabolic processes during schizogony in erythrocytes and hepatocytes.;"Caldelari, Reto; Dogga, Sunil; Franke-Fayard, Blandine; Heussler, Volker; Janse, Chris J.; Schmid, Marc W.; Soldati-Favre, Dominique";10.1186/s12936-019-2968-7;2019-12-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB23770;European Nucleotide Archive;Transcriptome analysis of Plasmodium berghei during exo-erythrocytic development;B862E34C-A50F-44E2-AB61-DB5378264178;159519

A comprehensive database of paleoclimate records is needed to place recent warming into the longer-term context of natural climate variability. We present a global compilation of quality-controlled, published, temperature-sensitive proxy records extending back 12,000 years through the Holocene. Data were compiled from 679 sites where time series cover at least 4000 years, are resolved at sub-millennial scale (median spacing of 400 years or finer) and have at least one age control point every 3000 years, with cut-off values slackened in data-sparse regions. The data derive from lake sediment (51%), marine sediment (31%), peat (11%), glacier ice (3%), and other natural archives. The database contains 1319 records, including 157 from the Southern Hemisphere. The multi-proxy database comprises paleotemperature time series based on ecological assemblages, as well as biophysical and geochemical indicators that reflect mean annual or seasonal temperatures, as encoded in the database. This database can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of Holocene temperature at global to regional scales, and is publicly available in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format.;Kaufman, Darrell;10.25921/4ry2-g808;2020-01-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/27330;NOAA Paleoclimatology Data;Temperature 12k Database;32E20F7C-3C92-4A54-B621-D1DE8BF5B7F5;169598

In the last years, light field imaging has experienced a surge of popularity among the scientific community for its capability of rendering the 3D world in a more immersive way. In particular, several compression algorithms have been proposed to efficiently reduce the amount of data generated in the acquisition process, and different methodologies have been designed to reliably evaluate the visual quality of compressed contents. In this paper we propose a dataset for visual quality assessment of light field images (VALID). The dataset contains five contents compressed at various bitrates, using both off-the-shelf solutions and state-of-the-art algorithms. Results of objective quality evaluation using popular image metrics are included, as well as annotated subjective scores using three different methodologies and two types of visualization setups. The proposed dataset will help develop new objective metrics to predict visual quality, design new subjective assessment methodologies and compare them to existing ones, as well as produce novel analysis approaches to interpret the results.;"Ebrahimi, Touradj; Viola, Irene";https://mmspg.epfl.ch/downloads/valid/;2018-06-01T00:00:00Z;https://mmspg.epfl.ch/downloads/valid/;VALID: Visual quality Assessment for Light field Images Dataset;VALID: Visual quality Assessment for Light field Images Dataset;3D9C09FF-0422-404C-8248-FB91B4D819B2;159575

Networks play a prominent role in the study of complex systems of interacting entities in biology, sociology, and economics. Despite this diversity, we demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of their architecture. The matching term quantifies the assortative structure in which node makes links with which other node, while the centrality term quantifies the number of links that nodes make. We show, for a diverse set of networks, that this decomposition can provide a tight fit to observed networks. Then we provide three applications. First, we show that the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when node characteris- tics are known, we show how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external information. Consequently, it offers a simple and versatile tool to explore how node characteristics ex- plain network architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of the model to forecast the links that a novel node would create if it were to join an existing network.;Rohr, Rudolf;10.5061/dryad.5fn84;2016-01-11T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5fn84;Dryad;Data from: Matching-centrality decomposition and the forecasting of new links in networks;89EFBE5F-1486-4D78-BD76-A111B8F905B4;138489
Aim: We aimed to determine differences in transcriptional profiles of GPR35-positive and negative macrophages in the steady state intestine.Method: Corresponding subpopulations were sorted by FACS from intestinal lamina propria cells of unmanipulated wild-type C56BL/6 mice. RNA from 4 replicates of each group were sequenced and analyzed.Result: GPR35 positive macrophages are transcriptionally distinct from GPR35 negative macrophages overall with 2798 downregulated and 2773 upregulated genes, and regarding cytokine expression profile with higher Il1b, Tnf and Il10 mRNA expressions.Conclusion: Our study reports the first analysis on transcriptional charasteristics of intestinal macrophages depending on their GPR35 expression providing insights into the function of GPR35 in these cells;Kaya, Berna;GSE131858;2020-06-25T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131858;Gene  Expression Omnibus;Low input RNA sequencing of GPR35-positive and negative intestinal macrophages;BDD2C4F9-4FA8-430F-A2A9-030065E3671F;175548

Throughout HIV-1 replication cycle, a complex interplay of host-pathogen interactions takes place in the infected cell, leading to production of new virions. The virus modulates the host cellular machinery in order to support its life cycle, while controlling intracellular defense. We have investigated the dynamic host response to HIV-1 infection by systematically measuring transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome expression changes in infected and uninfected SupT1 CD4+ T cells at 5 time-points throughout the HIV-1 replication cycle. Genome-wide transcript levels were assessed by RNA-Seq, while protein and phosphoprotein relative abundances were obtained using SILAC mass spectrometry. By the means of a Gaussian mixed-effects model, we stratified host genes based on their gene expression temporal patterns at the three levels, showing how HIV may affect regulation of certain host genes. The results of the implemented integrative analysis of time-series omics data offers a catalogue of dynamic host response to HIV infection allowing a more comprehensive understanding of host-virus interactions. Furthermore, it facilitates identifying novel host factors potentially promoting or restricting HIV replication.;Golumbeanu, Monica;GSE100587;2018-12-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100587;NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);RNA-Seq data;A8FAB54A-DF39-4DF5-A025-D07CE24C1908;166412
Throughout the HIV-1 replication cycle, complex host-pathogen interactions take place in the infectedcell, leading to the production of new virions. The virus modulates the host cellular machinery in orderto support its life cycle, while counteracting intracellular defense mechanisms. We investigated thedynamic host response to HIV-1 infection by systematically measuring transcriptomic, proteomic,and phosphoproteomic expression changes in infected and uninfected SupT1 CD4+ T cells at five timepoints of the viral replication process. By means of a Gaussian mixed-effects model implemented in thenew R/Bioconductor package TMixClust, we clustered host genes based on their temporal expressionpatterns. We identified a proteo-transcriptomic gene expression signature of 388 host genes specificfor HIV-1 replication. Comprehensive functional analyses of these genes confirmed the previouslydescribed roles of some of the genes and revealed novel key virus-host interactions affecting multiplemolecular processes within the host cell, including signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, andimmune system. The results of our analysis are accessible through a freely available, dedicated and userfriendlyR/Shiny application, called PEACHi2.0.

Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) often achieve remission yet subsequently die of disease relapse, which is commonly driven by chemotherapy-resistant leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). LSCs are defined by their capacity to initiate leukaemia in immuno-compromised mice. This precludes an analysis of their interaction with lymphocytes as components of anti-tumour immunity, which LSCs must escape in order to induce cancer7. Here we propose that stemness and immune evasion are closely intertwined in human AML. Using human AML xenograft and syngeneic mouse leukemia models, we show that ligands of the danger detector NKG2D, a critical mediator of anti-tumour immunity by cytotoxic lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells, are generally expressed on bulk AML cells but not on LSCs. Functional LSCs can be isolated by their lack of NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) expression, even in human AMLs not expressing the conventional LSC marker CD34. NKG2DL expressing AML cells are cleared by NK cells while NKG2DLneg leukaemic cells isolated from the same individuals escape NK cell killing. These NKG2DLneg AML cells show an immature morphology, display molecular and functional stemness characteristics, can initiate serially re-transplantable leukaemia and survive chemotherapy in patient-derived xenotransplants (PDX). Mechanistically, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) negatively regulates NKG2DL and PARP1 inhibition (PARPi) induces NKG2DL surface expression in LSCs. Consequently, co-treatment with PARPi and NK cells suppresses leukaemogenesis in PDX models. Low expression of surface NKG2DL as well as high PARP1 expression are associated with inferior clinical outcome in patients with AML. In summary, our data link the concept of LSCs to immune escape and indicate absence of immunostimulatory NKG2DL as a novel method to identify LSCs across genetic AML subtypes. Moreover, we provide a strong rationale for targeting therapy resistant LSCs by PARP1 inhibition rendering them amenable to NK cell control in vivo.;"Falcone, Mattia; Raffel, Simon; Trumpp, Andreas";GSE127959;;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127959;GEO;Absence of NKG2D ligands defines human leukaemia stem cells and mediates their immune evasion;06F548D3-980C-4791-8630-F592403AA852;179239

Abstract Self-reactive CD8 + T cells are important mediators of progressive tissue damage in autoimmune diseases, but the molecular program underlying these cells’ functional adaptation is unclear. Here we characterize the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of self-reactive CD8 + T cells in a mouse model of protracted central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity and compare it to populations of CNS-resident memory CD8 + T cells emerging from acute viral infection. We find that autoimmune CD8 + T cells persisting at sites of self-antigen exhibit characteristic transcriptional regulation together with distinct epigenetic remodeling. This self-reactive CD8 + T cell fate depends on the transcriptional regulation by the DNA-binding HMG-box protein TOX which remodels more than 400 genomic regions including loci such as Tcf7 , which is central to stemness of CD8 + T cells. Continuous exposure to CNS self-antigen sustains TOX levels in self-reactive CD8 + T cells, whereas genetic ablation of TOX in CD8 + T cells results in shortened persistence of self-reactive CD8 + T cells in the inflamed CNS. Our study establishes and characterizes the genetic differentiation program enabling chronic T cell-driven immunopathology in CNS autoimmunity.;"Di Liberto, Giovanni; Kaye, Jonathan; Klimek, Bogna; Lemeille, Sylvain; Mariotte, Alexandre; Merkler, Doron; Page, Nicolas; Vincenti, Ilena; Wagner, Ingrid";10.1038/s41467-021-21109-3;2021-12-12T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149643;Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the primary accession code;Persistence of self-reactive CD8+ T cells in the CNS requires TOX-dependent chromatin remodeling;BA5BA4D5-5545-4DC5-8DDA-F6377CB0EA8C;173010

We investigate optical absorption spectra obtained through time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) based on nonempirical hybrid functionals that are designed to correctly reproduce the dielectric function. The comparison with state-of-the-art GW calculations followed by the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE-GW) shows close agreement for both the transition energies and the main features of the spectra. We confront TD-DFT with BSE-GW by focusing on the model dielectric function and the local exchange-correlation kernel. The present TD-DFT approach achieves the accuracy of BSE-GW at a fraction of the computational cost.;Tal, Alexey;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:gn-2p;2020-09-11T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2020.108;Materials Cloud;Accurate optical spectra through time-dependent density functional theory based on screening-dependent hybrid functionals;DED7031F-7606-449B-9387-EE77564AB7E4;172524

Bile acids control lipid homeostasis by regulating uptake from food and excretion. Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity. In conclusion, the established LC-MS/MS method enables uncomplicated sample preparation and quantification of key bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue of human and rodent species to facilitate future studies of disease mechanisms and drug-induced liver injury.;"Bouitbir, Jamal; Gómez, Cristina; Kratschmar, Denise V; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon";10.5281/zenodo.4529169;2020-07-09T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4529169;Zenodo;Data_Supplemental_Figure1_Development and Validation of a Highly Sensitive LC-MS/MS Method for the Analysis of Bile Acids in Serum, Plasma, and Liver Tissue Samples;488D68A8-9578-448D-AA5D-F1D87D33A306;179400

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Echinococcus multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a rising zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere. Treatment of this fatal disease is limited to chemotherapy using benzimidazoles and surgical intervention, with frequent disease recurrence in cases without radical surgery. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying E. multilocularis infections and host-parasite interactions ultimately aids developing novel therapeutic options. This study explored an involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS) during E. multilocularis infection in mice.E. multilocularis- and mock-infected C57BL/6 mice were subdivided into vehicle, albendazole (ABZ) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (αPD-L1) treated groups. To mimic a chronic infection, treatments of mice started six weeks post i.p. infection and continued for another eight weeks. Liver tissue was then collected to examine inflammatory cytokines and the expression of UPR- and ERS-related genes.E. multilocularis infection led to an upregulation of UPR- and ERS-related proteins in the liver, including ATF6, CHOP, GRP78, ERp72, H6PD and calreticulin, whilst PERK and its target eIF2α were not affected, and IRE1α and ATF4 were downregulated. ABZ treatment in E. multilocularis infected mice reversed, or at least tended to reverse, these protein expression changes to levels seen in mock-infected mice. Furthermore, ABZ treatment reversed the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ in the liver of infected mice. Similar to ABZ, αPD-L1 immune-treatment tended to reverse the increased CHOP and decreased ATF4 and IRE1α expression levels.AE caused chronic inflammation, UPR activation and ERS in mice. The E. multilocularis-induced inflammation and consecutive ERS was ameliorated by ABZ and αPD-L1 treatment, indicating their effectiveness to inhibit parasite proliferation and downregulate its activity status. Neither ABZ nor αPD-L1 themselves affected UPR in control mice. Further research is needed to elucidate the link between inflammation, UPR and ERS, and if these pathways offer potential for improved therapies of patients with AE.;"Beldi, Guido; Gottstein, Bruno; Jebbawi, Fadi; Lundström-Stadelmann, Britta; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon; Wang, Junhua; Weingartner, Michael";10.5281/zenodo.5838187;2022-03-03T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5838187;zenodo;Data_Supplemental_Tab3_Albendazole reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by Echinococcus multilocularis in mice;9005A5B1-AC61-43AF-B23A-E960DC2D0148;179400

In this study we investigated alterations in the plasma membrane (PM)-associated proteome of DAOY medulloblastoma cells. We used a surface biotinylation approach to label PM-associated proteins. We enriched for biotinylated proteins by streptavidin-pull-down and determined the composition by mass-spectrometry. We compared CRISPR/CAS9 control cells and CRISPR/CAS9 MAP4K4 (MAP4K4 depletion) cells under starvation and after 30 min stimulation with 20 ng/ml HGF. We performed two group analyses of all conditions.;Martin, Baumgartner;http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD030597;2022-03-22T00:00:00Z;http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD030597;Pride;Growth factor-induced alterations of plasma membrane-associated proteome of DAOY cell;58A42752-4432-4356-8EC4-F5B139685296;165860
Non-typhoidal Salmonella and other enteric infections are associated with innate immunity-driven inflammatory responses and pathology. The vigorous immune response induced by a virulent pathogen generally leads to more efficacious mucosal immunity than exposure to an avirulent strain. Whether the associated inflammation stimulus is necessary or redundant for the induction of functional adaptive immunity is unclear and has been difficult to address experimentally. Here we show that live bacterial virulence factor-driven superior functional immunogenicity can be uncoupled from concomitant inflammatory pathology. We used a novel quantitative infection model of auxotrophic Salmonella enterica mutants in germ-free animals to dissect the bacterial parameters contributing to immunogenicity. Although mucosal Salmonella virulence factor function in this model no longer caused marked innate inflammatory responses, it remained the main driver of protective mucosal immunity. Isogenic virulence factor-deficient, like chemically inactivated, bacteria were significantly impaired in their protective immunogenicity. Despite their known functions in Salmonella-induced innate immunity, innate pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways through MYD88 and TRIF, Caspase-1 and -11, NLRC4, and NOD1 and -2 were redundant in vivo for the robust live Salmonella-induced mucosal adaptive immunity. These findings reveal exquisite system redundancy between the inductive mechanisms of innate and adaptive mucosal immunity that allows robust pathogen recognition and may be exploitable for the vaccination in innate immunodeficient individuals.;Hapfelmeier, Siegfried;PRJEB37168;2020-04-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB37168;ENA European Nucleotide Archive;"PRJEB37168 ";B08CCE3F-89AD-4274-913E-E98198A6649E;169791

In the associate article to these data sets, we present an X-ray tomographic imaging method that is well suited for pulmonary disease studies in animal models, to resolve the full pathway from gas intake to gas exchange. Current state-of-the-art synchrotron-based tomographic phase-contrast imaging methods allow for three-dimensional microscopic imaging data to be acquired non-destructively in scan times of the order of seconds with good soft tissue contrast. However, when studying multi-scale hierarchically structured objects, such as the mammalian lung, the overall sample size typically exceeds the field of view illuminated by the X-rays in a single scan, and the necessity for achieving a high spatial resolution conflicts with the need to image the whole sample. Several image-stitching and calibration techniques to achieve extended high-resolution fields of view have been reported, but those approaches tend to fail when imaging non-stable samples, thus precluding tomographic measurements of large biological samples, which are prone to degradation and motion during extended scan times. In this work, we demonstrate a full-volume three-dimensional reconstruction of an intact rat lung under immediate post mortem conditions and at an isotropic voxel size of (2.75 µm)^3. We present the methodology for collecting multiple local tomographies with 360 degree extended field of view scans followed by locally non-rigid volumetric stitching. Applied to the lung, it allows to resolve the entire pulmonary structure from the trachea down to the parenchyma in a single dataset.

Description: Raw sequence readsAbstract: Central America is largely covered by hyperdiverse, yet poorly understood, rain forests. Understorey palms are diverse components of these forests, but little is known about their historical assembly. It is not clear when palms in Central America reached present diversity levels and whether most species arrived from neighbouring regions or evolved locally. We addressed these questions using the most species rich American palm clades indicative of rain forests. We reconstructed and compared their phylogenomic and biogeographical history with the diversification of 54 other plant lineages, to gain a better understanding of the processes that shaped the assembly of Central American rain forests. Location Central America. Time period Cretaceous to present. Major taxa studied Arecaceae,Arecoideae,Bactridinae, Chamaedoreeae, Geonomateae. Methods We sampled 218 species through fieldwork and living collections. We sequenced their genomic DNA using target sequence capture procedures. Using 12 calibration points, we reconstructed dated phylogenies under three approaches (multispecies coalescent, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference), conducted biogeographical analyses (dispersal extinction cladogenesis) and estimated phylogenetic diversity metrics. Results Dated phylogenies revealed intense diversification in Central America from 12 Ma. Local diversification events were four times more frequent than dispersal events, and we found strong phylogenetic clustering in relationship to Central America. Main conclusions Our results suggest that most understorey palm species that characterize the Central American rain forests today evolved locally after repeated dispersal events, mostly from South America. Understorey palms in Central American rain forests diversified primarily after closure of the Central American Seaway at c. 13 Ma, suggesting that the Great American Biotic Interchange was a major trigger for plant diversification in Central American rain forests. This recent diversification contrasts with the much earlier existence of rain forest palms in neighbouring South America since c. 58 Ma. We found similar timings of diversification in 54 other seed plant lineages, suggesting an unexpectedly recent assembly of the hyperdiverse Central American flora.;"Andermann, Tobias; Antonelli, Alexandre; Bacon, Christine D.; Cano, Angela; Christe, Camille; Liberal, Isabel M.; Lorenzi, Harri; Perret, Mathieu; Stauffer, Fred W.; Töpel, Mats; Zizka, Alexander";PRJNA535438;2019-04-25T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/535438;National Center for Biotechnology Information;Recent and local diversification of Central American understorey palms;26EB6204-8D9B-433D-8757-EC6ED1356D7C;175655

This dataset is  WHISPER SET 1, a dataset for speech enhancement and source separation recorded with a Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN) called WHISPER Kiselev2018. The dataset contains samples for up to 4 concurrent speakers and speech in noise. The dataset was recorded in a room with low reverberation (T_60 = 0.2 s) and using 16 microphones. In general, each track contains first a calibration phase where each of the speakers sequentially is active alone for 15 seconds. Followed by 15 seconds of all the speakers together (plus noise in some cases).;"Ceolini, Enea; Kiselev, Ilya; Liu, Shih-Chii";https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3688540;2020-05-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3688540;WHISPER SET 1;WHISPER SET 1: a dataset for multi-channel, multi-device speech separation and speech enhancement;33DA0BE8-3DBA-4483-AB62-F8825AE75140;172553

Community assembly theory assumes that ecological communities are spatially delimited into patches. Within these patches, coexistence results from environmental filtering, competition, and immigration. Truly delineated communities exist in laboratory studies of microbial cultures in Petri dishes, yet empirical tests conducted in continuous environments often use patches defined by convention as opposed to realised boundaries. Here we perform a test of ecological community assembly rules using foliar endophyte communities from a tropical rainforest, where leaves are considered as patches for both fungal and bacterial communities. We determined the diversity of fungal and bacterial endophytes using environmental DNA sequencing of 365 top-canopy leaves, collected from 38 host trees belonging to 22 different species across a 4-hectare research plot. Three leaves were collected from three or more branches within each tree crown. We tested the effect of host tree species and their level of phylogenetic relatedness on community composition as well as the contribution of geographic distance between leaves to endophyte community diversity.  Endophyte diversity significantly differed across host tree species, as did community composition. Within certain endophytic orders (Xylariales, Rhizobiales) species assemblages significantly differed across host tree species, but this trend was weaker or non-existent in other orders known to contain pathogens and saprotrophs (Polyporales, Solirubrobacterales). Phylogenetically related host tree species displayed more similar endophyte communities than expected by chance, but geographically close trees did not. Consistent with the finding of host-specificity, nearby leaves tended to host more similar communities than distantly positioned ones. These findings demonstrate that foliar endophytes are structured by dispersal across small spatial scales, but at the scale of the canopy they display patterns of neutral filtering, with only a small part of variation described by host tree differences. Endophyte communities thus act as a model system in evoking the rules predicted by theoretical community ecology.;Donald, Julian;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bcc2fqz7v;2019-12-18T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.bcc2fqz7v;dryad;Data from: A test of community assembly rules using foliar endophytes from a tropical forest canopy;353B35E8-1E9F-4CF1-A694-ED58F8A9F707;164289

Organism: Mus musculusExperiment type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingSummary: We previously reported the cyclin dependent kinase Cdk8 as a putative silencing factor for Xist. Here we investigate the role of Cdk8 in X inactivation and embryo development. We engineered a Cdk8 mutation in mouse embryonic stem cells carrying an inducible system for studying Xist function. We find that Xist repressed X-linked genes to half the expression level of the active X chromosome in the absence of Cdk8, whereas near complete silencing was observed in cells with intact Cdk8. The reduced ability of Xist to repress genes is paralleled with reduced Ezh2 recruitment and establishment of histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation. Introduction of wild-type but not catalytically inactive Cdk8 transgenes restores efficient gene repression and PRC2 recruitment. Notably, mutation of the highly homologous kinase Cdk19 does not affect Xist function. Combined mutations of Cdk8 and Cdk19 resemble the Cdk8 single mutation. Analysis of a conditional Cdk8 mutation in mice reveals a post-implantation lethal phenotype with variable onset between day 8.5 and 10.5. A clear female specific phenotype is masked by requirements of Cdk8 for processes in addition to X inactivation. Overall design: Differential Gene expression upon Xist expression in the presence and absence of Cdk8 in mouse embryonic stem cells;"Postlmayr, Andreas; Wutz, Anton";GSE129338;2019-04-05T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE129338;Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);Cdk8 is required for establishment of chromatin marks and gene repression by Xist and mouse embryonic lineage development;B75E481D-FBF5-4DB7-A68A-59DFDE8F9009;175643
We previously identified the cyclin dependent kinase Cdk8 as a putative silencing factor for Xist. To investigate its role in X inactivation, we engineered a Cdk8 mutation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) carrying an inducible system for studying Xist function. We find that Xist represses X-linked genes to half the expression level in Cdk8 mutant cells, whereas near complete silencing is observed in controls. Lack of Cdk8 impairs Ezh2 recruitment and establishment of histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation but not PRC1 recruitment by Xist. Transgenic expression of wild-type but not catalytically inactive Cdk8 restores efficient gene repression and PRC2 recruitment. Mutation of the paralogous kinase Cdk19 does not affect Xist function and combined mutations of Cdk8 and Cdk19 resemble the Cdk8 mutation. In mice a Cdk8 mutation causes post-implantation lethality. We observe that homozygous Cdk8 mutant female embryos show a greater developmental delay than males on day 10.5. Together with inefficient repression of X-linked genes in differentiating Cdk8 mutant female ESCs these data show a requirement of Cdk8 for the initiation of X inactivation.MethodsMicroscopy pictures of embryos were taken and image segmentation was performed as explained in the journal article. The embryo sizes were determined in pixel as indicated for each embryo in the PDF files. For each litter a CSV formatted table is provided with all embryo sizes of the litter. The dataset contains details of intermediates of image processing, and all measurements of embryo size that were used in the study for embryo size calculations.Usage notesTo use this dataset the journal article in Development should be consulted.

Nutrient supply to ecosystems has major effects on ecological diversity, but it is unclear to what degree the shape of this relationship is general versus dependent on the specific environment or community. Although the diet composition in terms of the source or proportions of different nutrient types is known to affect gut microbiota composition, the relationship between the quantity of nutrients supplied and the abundance and diversity of the intestinal microbial community remains to be elucidated. Here we address this relationship using replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster maintained over multiple generations on three diets differing in the concentration of yeast (the only source of most nutrients). While a 6.5-fold increase in yeast concentration led to a 100-fold increase in the total abundance of gut microbes, it caused a major decrease in their alpha diversity (by 45-60 % depending on the diversity measure). This was accompanied by only minor shifts in the taxonomic affiliation of the most common operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Thus, nutrient concentration in host diet mediates a strong negative relationship between the nutrient abundance and microbial diversity in the Drosophila gut ecosystem.;"Erkosar, Berra; Kawecki, Tadeusz";doi:10.5061/ dryad.t0554g0;;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.t0554g0;Dryad;Data from: Host diet mediates a negative relationship between abundance and diversity of Drosophila gut microbiota;8893EE59-3AEF-40C6-9489-EBA2F2CE7408;162732

In this project, we investigated the emergence of ferroelectric polarization isotropy in the morphotropic phase boundary region of the relaxor ferroelectric materials. The spontaneous symmetry breaking and resultant ferroelectric polarization of the conventional ferroelectric materials are strongly coupled to the crystal field. However, near the morphotropic phase boundary, especially the boundary between the tetragonal and the rhombohedral phases, the macroscopic polarization is decoupled from the crystal field and manifests isotropic behavior. On the mesoscopic scale, the high density of chemical defects and the corresponding stoichiometric inhomogeneity stabilize the polar slush structure. The theoretical model based on the Landau theory is developed, and the generality of isotropic nature at the morphotropic phase boundary is predicted by the model. We investigated experimentally a PIN-PMN-PT single crystal as a model system, and visualized the nanoscale polarization field by the angle-resolved lateral piezoresponse force microscopy (AR-LPFM) revealing the polarization distribution similar to that obtained by our simulations.;Chu, Kanghyun;10.5281/zenodo.5730294;2021-11-25T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/5730294#.Yd3Ezywo9-8;zenodo;Phase field modelling and PFM study of defects in ferroic materials;D22D48F5-F174-4FF5-B784-E9593ABEE06A;197145

Endothelial cell (EC)-derived signals contribute to organ regeneration, but angiocrine metabolic communication is not described. We found that EC-specific loss of the glycolytic regulator pfkfb3 reduced ischemic hindlimb revascularization and impaired muscle regeneration. This was caused by the reduced ability of macrophages to adopt a proangiogenic and proregenerative M2-like phenotype. Mechanistically, loss of pfkfb3 reduced lactate secretion by ECs and lowered lactate levels in the ischemic muscle. Addition of lactate to pfkfb3-deficient ECs restored M2-like polarization in an MCT1-dependent fashion. Lactate shuttling by ECs enabled macrophages to promote proliferation and fusion of muscle progenitors. Moreover, VEGF production by lactate-polarized macrophages was increased, resulting in a positive feedback loop that further stimulated angiogenesis. Finally, increasing lactate levels during ischemia rescued macrophage polarization and improved muscle reperfusion and regeneration, whereas macrophage-specific mct1 deletion prevented M2-like polarization. In summary, ECs exploit glycolysis for angiocrine lactate shuttling to steer muscle regeneration from ischemia.;"Banfi, Andrea; Carmeliet, Peter; D’Hulst, Gommaar; De Bock, Katrien; Fan, Zheng; Fendt, Sarah-Maria; Fitzgerald, Gillian; Gianni-Barrera, Roberto; Gilardoni, Paola; Gorski, Tatiane; Kopf, Manfred; Masschelein, Evi; Muri, Jonathan; Pellerin, Luc; Planque, Mélanie; Soro-Arnáiz, Inés; Stockmann, Christian; Turiel, Guillermo; Wang, TongTong; Wolfrum, Christian; Zhang, Jing";10.1016/j.cmet.2020.05.004;2020-06-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120302436?via%3Dihub#app2;Cell Metabolism;Endothelial Lactate Controls Muscle Regeneration from Ischemia by Inducing M2-like Macrophage Polarization;811C26DD-A02F-48F7-BFAA-B30F2829E810;176056

Purpose: We performed a time-course single-cell RNA-seq of the somatic cells of the XY mouse gonads to study the cell population heterogeneity and the genetic program during their differentiation.Methods: We collected gonads from NR5A1-eGFP transgenic embryos at five embryonic stages: E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E16.5. Cells were captured with the C1 autoprep system and cDNA sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2000.Results: One cell population was detected at E10.5 and gives rise to both Sertoli and fetal Leydig cells. A precursor cell population remains undifferentiated at E16.5 and are likely to be adult Leydig cell precursors.Conclusion: Our study is, to date, the most granular transcriptomic study of the developing mouse testis and provide a more complete model of somatic cell differentiation during male sex determination.;Nef, Serge;GSE97519;2018-02-06T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97519;GEO GSE97519;Single-cell RNA-seq of NR5A1-eGFP positive cells of the developing mouse testis from E10.5 to E16.5;A1C29C50-C4DE-4A56-A7CC-ED1D76B44D35;173070

In the pyrochlore magnet Ce2Sn2O7, we have established that a correlated disordered ground state develops below about 0.6 K, and that the Ce3+ magnetic ions have both dipole and octupole degrees of freedom. Our magnetization and susceptibility data measured in this low-temperature correlated state can be interpreted using a mean-field model of correlated higher-order multipolar degrees of freedom. This idea agrees with the absence of magnetic scattering at low values of momentum transfer, in previous experiments using cold neutrons, which would have indicated correlations among the dipoles. We propose to look for signatures of hidden correlations from these multipoles using the time-of-flight spectrometer MERLIN.;Sibille, Romain;10.5286/ISIS.E.RB1910467;2019-03-14T00:00:00Z;https://data.isis.stfc.ac.uk/doi/STUDY/101224927/;ISIS Neutron and Muon Source Data Catalogue;Hidden correlations in Ce2Sn2O7;CEFC77F3-EEA9-4671-817E-EE1068F9598D;179150
The Quantum Spin Ice (QSI) state, where the two-in-two-out configurations formed by the Ising variables are allowed to tunnel among themselves, is realised in Pr2Hf2O7 based on our last measurements on IN5 (Nature Physics, 14, 711-715 (2018)). The quantum field theory (quantum electrodynamics) that was used to compare with our data, predicts another distinctive feature for this ground state: the suppression of the pinch points, as compared to the sharp anisotropic features observed in classical spin ices, should be progressive as a function of temperature (Phys. Rev. B, 86, 075154 (2012)). We propose to measure this temperature dependence, which will put further limits on the parameters of the theory used to reproduce the experimental data. Moreover, in a second time, we propose to use a longer wavelength in order to better measure the lower edge of the continuum of spin excitations, where a 'threshold effect' was recently predicted by theory (arXiv:1906.01628).;Sibille, Romain;10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-793;2021-01-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.ill.fr/10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-793;Institute Laue–Langevin data portal;Origins of the Quantum Spin Ice state and Threshold Effect in Pr2Hf2O7;5FB06903-FD80-4114-ACBF-F2D47EC7FC49;179150
The performance of functional materials is either driven or limited by nanoscopic heterogeneities distributed throughout the material’s volume. To better our understanding of these materials, we need characterization tools that allow us to determine the nature and distribution of these heterogeneities in their native geometry in 3D. These datasets contain measurements of pristine and industrially used vanadium phosphorous oxide (VPO) catalysts. The experiments were conducted using combined method of x-ray near-edge spectroscopy, ptychographic x-ray computed nanotomography, and sparsity techniques. The method allows the acquisition of quantitative multimodal tomograms of representative sample volumes at sub-30 nm half-period spatial resolution within practical acquisition times, which enables local structure refinements in complex geometries.

Observations (halocarbon_observations.tar.gz) are post-processed observations of the AGAGE network (http://agage.mit.edu/) plus those gathered at the Finokalia site (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1186221).Inversion results (inversion_results.tar) are contained as separate  packages for each individual sensitivity experiment described in the publication. The sensitivity experiments are listed in inversion_results/InversionRuns.xlsx and agree with those listed in Table 1 of the publication. Subfolders are organised by halocarbon species: HCFC_142b, HCFC_22, HFC_125, HFC_152a, HFC_134, HFC_143a. For each halocarbon results are stored in form of plots, ASCII spread sheets (csv, dat) or R data objects (.rda). Time series and distribution plots are available in separate subfolders. Intermediate data used by the inversion code are stored in 'intermediates', whereas the final results of each inversion run are stored as a single R object (inversion_results_XXX.rda).;Henne, Stephan;https://zenodo.org/record/1194645#.XA6JkIoxlOQ;2018-03-09T00:00:00Z;https://www.zenodo.org;Zenodo;Atmospheric inversion results: sources of atmospheric halocarbons in the Eastern Mediterranean;D4096A46-D968-4EA1-9F5A-EB2253E7BB1B;137638
Atmospheric halocarbon (HFC, HCFC) observations (mole fractions) from the site Finokalia (FKL, 35.34 °N, 25.67 °E, 250 m a.s.l.) on the island of Crete, Greece, covering the period December 2012 to August 2013). The measurements were conducted using a gas chromatograph(Agilent 6890) and:mass spectrometer (Agilent 5973) (GC-MS), coupled to an adsorption desorption system (ADS) for preconcentration of samples from the air (Simmonds et al., 1995).The measurements are described in detail in: Schoenenberger, F., S.

Cell-cycle transitions are generally triggered by variations in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria-causing parasites have evolved unique cell-cycles with a repertoire of ancestral CDKs and cyclins whose functions and interdependency remain elusive. Here, we show that the divergent Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical cell-cycle regulator of gametogony required for transmission to the mosquito. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs on components of the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. We also provide evidence for indirect regulation of the concomitant progression through M-phase. Over a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Plasmodium-specific cyclin (SOC2) with no evidence of SOC2 cycling through transcription, translation nor degradation. Our results present evidence that during Plasmodium gametogony, a unique and divergent cyclin/CDK pair evolved to fulfil the functional space of multiple eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases controlling S-phase entry and progression through M-phase.;"Brochet, Mathieu; Hainard, Alexandre";PXD017308;;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017308;PRIDE;A divergent cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex controls progression through the atypical replicative cycles during Plasmodium berghei gametogony;648E7F47-56D2-4826-A36E-F1B863DA8DD9;179321

"Cryptic alleles make a bridge for adaptation Protein function is generally constrained by selective parameters that can inhibit evolutionary potential. It has thus been difficult to determine how novelties arise. Zheng et al. allowed bacterial populations to accumulate mutations and then used directed evolution to evolve green fluorescent protein function from a gene that expressed yellow fluorescent protein (see the Perspective by Lee and Marx). Protein alternatives could evolve in cases where cryptic alleles-selectively neutral or mildly deleterious genetic variants with no apparent phenotypic differences-were present in the population. Thus, cryptic alleles provide an evolutionary bridge between diversity and selection and facilitate the generation of novel adaptations.

Strongly correlated quantum solids are characterized by an inherently granular electronic fabric, with spatial patterns that can span multiple length scales in proximity to a critical point. Here, we use a resonant magnetic X-ray scattering nanoprobe with sub-100 nm spatial resolution to directly visualize the texture of antiferromagnetic domains in NdNiO3. Surprisingly, our measurements reveal a highly textured magnetic fabric, which we show to be robust and nonvolatile even after thermal erasure across its ordering temperature. The scalefree distribution of antiferromagnetic domains and its non-integral dimensionality point to a hitherto-unobserved magnetic fractal geometry in this system. These scale-invariant textures directly reflect the continuous nature of the magnetic transition and the proximity of this system to a critical point. The present study not only exposes the near-critical behavior in rare earth nickelates but also underscores the potential for X-ray scattering nanoprobes to image the multiscale signatures of criticality near a critical point.;"Carlson, Erica; Catalano, Sara; Comin, Riccardo; Gibert, Marta; Levitan, Abraham; Li, Jiarui; Mazzoli, Claudio; Pelliciari, Jonathan; Sadowski, Jerzy T.; Simmons, Forrest; Triscone, Jean-Marc; Wikins, Stuart";10.26037/yareta:acqfapvmkrflzaz2xdzik56kgi;2019-10-15T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:acqfapvmkrflzaz2xdzik56kgi;Yareta;Scale-invariant magnetic textures in the strongly correlated oxide NdNiO3;1FBC950E-6D71-4874-868D-E98CFE4C561F;179155

Aerosol properties were measured between February 8 and March 31 2019 at the measurement site Davos Wolfgang (LON: 9.853594, LAT: 46.835577). Optical and aerodynamic particle counters, as well as a scanning mobility particle size spectrometer and an ice nuclei counter were deployed to report particle concentrations and size distributions in fine (10-1000 nm) and coarse mode (> 1000 nm), cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (CCNCs) and ice nuclei particle concentrations (ICNCs). The ambient particles were transported via a heated inlet to be distributed to the particle detecting devices inside the setup room.Optical Particle Counter (OPC): Light scattering of a diode laser beam caused by travelling particles is used in the both, the OPC-N3 (0.41 - 38.5 μm) and GT-526S (0.3 - 5 μm), to determine their size and number concentration. For the OPC-N3, particle size spectra and concentration data are used afterwards to calculate PM₁, PM₂,₅ and PM₁₀ (assumptions: particle density: 1.65 g cm³, refractive index: 1.5+i0).Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS): The APS (3321, TSI Inc.) measured the particle size distribution for aerodynamic diameters between 0.5 μm and ~20 μm by the particle’s time-of-flight and light-scattering intensity (assumptions: particle density 1 g cm³).Scanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS): Particle number concentrations in a size range between 12 and 460 nm (electrical mobility diameter) were measured at Davos Wolfgang, using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer Spectrometer (3938, TSI Inc.). The classifier (3082, TSI Inc.) was equipped with a neutralizer (3088, TSI Inc.) and a differential mobility analyzer working with negative polarity (3081, TSI Inc.). The size selected particles were counted by a water-based condensation particle counter (3788 , TSI Inc.). The TSI AIM software was used to provide particle size distributions by applying multiple charge and diffusion loss corrections (assumptions: particle density 1 g cm³).Coriolis μ and DRINCZ: A microbial air sampler (Coriolis μ, bertin Instruments) was used to collect airborne particles for investigating their ice nucleating ability with a droplet freezing device. Particles larger than 0.5 μm were drawn with an air flow rate of up to 300 l min¹ into the cone and centrifuged into the wall of the cone due to the forming vortex. The liquid sample was transferred into the DRoplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (DRINCZ, ETH Zurich) to study heterogeneous ice formation (immersion freezing mode) of ambient airborne particles.;"Rösch, Carolin; Wieder, Jörg";doi: 10.16904/envidat.157;2020-05-26T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/aerosol-data-davos-wolfgang;Envidat;Aerosol Data Davos Wolfgang;42B8284A-F23C-436F-87CB-ED646E31CA57;175824

1. Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the impact of landscape changes. 2. Wildflower strips are ecological compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination services and biological control of crop pests, and to conserve insect diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species richness and abundance of the fauna. 3. We describe results from experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape, comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement, and of vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. 4. The proportion of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements, resulting in a more complex trap nest community with higher abundance and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food-web metrics. 5. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a potentially stable community of cavity nesting hymenoptera in wildflower strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial insect populations.;Fabian, Yvonne;10.5061/dryad.ck842;2013-07-17T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.ck842;Dryad;Data from: The importance of landscape and spatial structure for hymenopteran-based food webs in an agro-ecosystem;12F15C51-45AA-477B-B83B-E8C519665399;138489

The identification of strategic interactions among local governments is typically plagued by endogeneity problems. I exploit the fact that local jurisdictions located close to a state border have some neighbors in another state and instrument the tax rate of neighbor jurisdictions with the state-level tax rate of the neighboring state. I use this instrument to identify strategic personal income tax setting by local jurisdictions in Switzerland and find that tax rates are strategic substitutes. I then develop a residence-based personal income tax competition model and show that tax rates are strategic substitutes if the elasticity of the marginal utility of the public good with respect to the tax rate is above one. This is notably the case in the presence of economies of scale in the public good provision.;Parchet, Raphaël;https://doi.org/10.3886/E114646V1;2019-10-13T00:00:00Z;https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/114646/version/V1/view;" Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research";Replication data for: Are Local Tax Rates Strategic Complements or Strategic Substitutes?;DE9C41A2-B5CC-4DD4-9C41-E75A9F544DD3;159348

The diffusion of water molecules and clusters across the surfaces of materials is important to a wide range of processes. Interestingly, experiments have shown that on certain substrates, water dimers can diffuse more rapidly than water monomers. Whilst explanations for anomalously fast diffusion have been presented for specific systems, the general underlying physical principles are not yet established. We investigate this through a systematic ab initio study of water monomer and dimer diffusion on a range of surfaces. Calculations reveal different mechanisms for fast water dimer diffusion, which is found to be more widespread than previously anticipated. The key factors affecting diffusion are the balance of water-water versus water-surface bonding and the ease with which hydrogen-bond exchange can occur (either through a classical over-the-barrier process or through quantum-mechanical tunnelling). We anticipate that the insights gained will be useful for understanding future experiments on the diffusion and clustering of hydrogen-bonded adsorbates.;"Chen, Ji; Fang, Wei; Li, Xin-Zheng; Michaelides, Angelos; Pedevilla, Philipp; Richardson, Jeremy O.";10.1038/s41467-020-15377-8;2020-12-03T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15377-8;Supporting Information;Origins of fast diffusion of water dimers on surfaces;B3154B56-8DF3-46D7-80A1-F255BD779C9A;175696

Expression profiling by arrayStudies on aging have largely included one or two OMICS layers, which may not necessarily reflect the signatures of other layers. Moreover, most aging studies have often compared very young (4-5 wks) mice with old (24 months) mice which does not reflect the aging transition after the attainment of adulthood. Therefore, we aimed to study and compared muti-OMICS aging signatures across key metabolic tissues of mature adults (6 months) and old (24 months) C57BL/6J mice (the most commonly used mouse strain).We compared the differentially regulated genes and enriched pathways for transcriptome, proteome and epigenome (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, DNA methylation) across different tissues.

Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingDNA variants that modulate lifespan provide insight into determinants of health, disease, and aging. Through analyses in the UM-HET3 mice of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), we detected a sex-independent quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 12 and identified sex-specific QTLs, some of which detected only in older mice. Similar relations between life history and longevity were uncovered in mice and humans, underscoring the importance of early access to nutrients and early growth. We identified common, age- and sex-specific genetic effects on gene expression that we integrated with model organism and human data to create a hypothesis-building interactive resource of prioritized longevity and body weight genes. Finally, we validated Hipk1, Ddost, Hspg2, Fgd6, and Pdk1 as conserved longevity genes using C. elegans lifespan experiments.;Bou Sleiman, Maroun;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE194321;2022-09-30T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE194321;NCBI - GEO;Sex- and age-dependent genetics of longevity in a heterogeneous mouse population;0B18A94F-6EA8-497F-B2DF-F68F80CD2A89;179435

The aim of this present study was to characterize the complex transcriptome changes in different endometrial cell types during the preimplantation period for improving our understanding of localization of endometrial gene expression regulation in context of recognition of pregnancy. To do this analysis in a transcriptome-wide manner, RNA-seq was performed for samples derived from luminal epithelium (LE), glandular epithelium (GE), blood vessel (BV), and stroma (S) isolated by the use of LCM.Overall design: Four types of endometrial cells, luminal epithelial (LE), glandular epithelial (GE), blood vessel (BV), and stromal cells (S) were isolated by laser capture microdissection from endometria of Day 14 pregnant and cyclic control gilts (each group n=4), respectively, and then subjected to RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). The obtained datasets were compared to a RNA-Seq dataset from complete endometrial tissue samples collected in the same experiment.;"Bauersachs, Stefan; Bick, Jochen; Ulbrich, Susanne E.; Zeng, Shuqin";GSE123265;2019-10-29T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123265;NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus;Spatial organization of endometrial gene expression at the onset of embryo attachment in pigs;EA9A8CDF-3095-4DF2-A7EE-F0EE73E5DF5C;173171

"The present data was collected from August to October 2019 as part of a replication attempt of a previously published study (Ellrich, J., and R-D. Treede. ""Convergence of nociceptive and non-nociceptive inputs onto spinal reflex pathways to the tibialis anterior muscle in humans."" Acta physiologica scandinavica 163.4 (1998): 391-401, https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-201X.1998.t01-1-00392.x). The results of the replication study have been published under open access (Guekos, A., et al. ""Are changes in nociceptive withdrawal reflex magnitude a viable central sensitization proxy? Implications of a replication attempt"" Clinical Neurophysiology 145 (2023): 139-150, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2022.09.011).Details of the paradigm, the experimental setup, and the analysis can be found there.In brief, 16 healthy adults (8 men and 8 women) underwent a single experimental session during which a tonic heat stimulus was applied on one leg to the foot sole and on the other to the calf muscle. Both legs were tested consecutively in pseudorandom order. Concurrently, subjects received transcutaneous electrical stimuli to elicit the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR). The muscle responses were recorded via surface electromyography (sEMG) from the biceps femoris (BF), rectus femoris (RF), and tibialis anterior (TA).The protocol consisisted of eight blocks per leg. During the first two blocks no temperature stimulation was applied. These two blocks served to identify the NWR threshold at the BF. For threshold determination, a single ascending staircase with either single electrical stimulations or triplets (at 2Hz) were used. From the triplets, only the muscle response to the third stimulation was analysed. The higher of the two obtained currents was used as the threshold. The following six blocks used six different temperatures (one per block) of 32, 36, 39, 42, 45 and 46 centigrade. During each block eight transcutaneous electrical stimuli were applied, either to the medial plantar nerve (MP) on the foot sole or to the retromalleolar pathway of the sural nerve (SU). The stimulations increased from -4 mA w.r.t. threshold to 200% threhold. Participants verbally rated perceived pain for every stimulation during these six blocks.Every electrical stimulation consisted of a train of five rectangular stimuli of 1 ms duration delivered at 200 Hz. Muscle responses were recorded from 120 pre- to 380 ms post-stimulation. The recorded sEMG signals were sampled at 48 kHz and downsampled to 6 kHz, rectified, band-pass filtered from 10 Hz to 500 Hz and amplified up to 125 times. Between 120 ms pre- and 380 ms post-stimulation, traces for all applied stimulations were automatically saved into separate txt files.Please consult the README.txt file for details on the structure of the uploaded data and for information w.r.t. potential instances of incompleteness or unusability.The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation as part of a grant to PS (grant number 320030_179191/1).";Schweinhardt, Petra;"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7811853 ";2023-04-09T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/7811853#.ZDOsOntBxPY;Zenodo;"Source Data for Published Study ""Are changes in nociceptive withdrawal reflex magnitude a viable central sensitization proxy?

Circadian oscillations emerge from transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops. An important step in generating rhythmicity is the translocation of clock components into the nucleus, which is regulated in many cases by kinases. In mammals, the kinase promoting the nuclear import of the key clock component Period 2 (PER2) is unknown. Here, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulates the mammalian circadian clock involving phosphorylation of PER2. Knock-down of Cdk5 in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the main coordinator site of the mammalian circadian system, shortened the free-running period in mice. CDK5 phosphorylated PER2 at serine residue 394 (S394) in a diurnal fashion. This phosphorylation facilitated interaction with Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) and nuclear entry of the PER2-CRY1 complex. Taken together, we found that CDK5 drives nuclear entry of PER2, which is critical for establishing an adequate circadian period of the molecular circadian cycle. Of note is that CDK5 may not exclusively phosphorylate PER2, but in addition may regulate other proteins that are involved in the clock mechanism. Taken together, it appears that CDK5 is critically involved in the regulation of the circadian clock and may represent a link to various diseases affected by a derailed circadian clock.;"Albrecht, Urs; Brenna, Andrea; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Chavan, Rohit; De Virgilio, Claudio; Dengjel, Jörn; Hu, Zehan; Langmesser, Sonja; Olejniczak, Iwona; Ripperger, Jürgen A";10.5061/dryad.j1fd7;2019-11-05T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4067r78;Dryad Digital repository;Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulates the circadian clock;CE49E281-22DF-4C76-9269-AE829D975E67;184667

Cancers are composed of various cell types. We present an efficient algorithm to simultaneously Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC) from bulk tumor gene expression data. Our method integrates novel gene expression profiles from each major non-malignant cell type found in tumors, renormalization based on cell-type specific mRNA content, and the ability to consider uncharacterized and possibly highly variable cell types. Feasibility is demonstrated by validation with flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA-seq analyses of human melanoma and colorectal tumor specimens. Altogether, our work not only improves accuracy but also broadens the scope of absolute cell fraction predictions from tumor gene expression data, and provides a unique novel experimental benchmark for immunogenomics analyses in cancer research.;"Gfeller, David; Racle, Julien";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse93722;2018-11-15T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse93722;Gene Expression Omnibus;Simultaneous enumeration of cancer and immune cell types from tumor gene expression data;8E4C221B-F766-4B8F-9049-50D7D4D79E5C;173156

In this data collection, we are particularly interested in providing the first dataset focusing on a unified search framework for mobile devices by collecting cross-app mobile queries as well as their target apps. To this end, we initially asked crowdworkers to explain their latest search experience on their smartphones and used them to define various realistic mobile search tasks. Then, we asked another set of workers to select the apps they would choose to complete the tasks as well as the query they would submit. One of the key takeaway findings is that for the majority of the search tasks, most of the users prefer not to use Google Search. Here, we release the dataset for research purposes.;"Aliannejadi, Mohammad; Crestani, Fabio; Croft, W.

The authors would highly appreciate to be contacted if the data is used for any purpose.We measured equivalent black carbon (eBC) with an aethalometer (model AE33, Magee Scientific) at a time resolution of one second during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). We report five-minute averaged data, cleaned from exhaust gas influence. Temporal coverage is from December 20, 2016 to April 10, 2017.The mass concentration of eBC, reported in ng m-3, reflects how far fossil fuel combustion or biomass burning contribute to the aerosol population over the Southern Ocean and between South Africa and Europe. Over the Southern Ocean there are no sources of eBC, except for ship emissions and (sub-)Antarctic station emissions, and hence an enhancement of eBC points towards long-range influence from Africa, Australia, New Zealand and South America. When plotted against latitude, eBC concentrations drop south of 60°S, indicating a more pristine environment. Elevated concentration around the equator are likely influenced by biomass burning in tropical Africa.;"Baccarini, Andrea; Bukowiecki, Nicolas; Gysel-Beer, Martin; Hartmann, Markus; Henning, Silvia; Lehtipalo, Katrianne; Schmale, Julia; Tatzelt, Christian; Tummon, Fiona; Welti, André";10.5281/zenodo.2636763;2019-06-19T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/2636763#.XvWZltXKFhE;Zenodo;Equivalent black carbon aerosol measured over the Southern Ocean in the austral summer of 2016/2017, during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition;6BD73896-82A1-4F88-A2E7-1D918BF20960;169090
The authors would highly appreciate being contacted if the data is used for any purpose.We measured methanesulfonic acid concentration in the gas phase with a nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometer (we used an APi-HTOF mass spectrometer produced by Tofwerk AG coupled with a Chemical ionization inlet A70 produced by Airmodus). Methanesulfonic acid is detected in the mass spectrometer either as a deprotonated ion or as a cluster with the reagent ion (NO3-). The concentration is calculated as the area of these two peaks normalized to the concentration of the reagent ions (monomer, dimer and trimer) and multiplied by a calibration factor that was experimentally derived at Paul Scherrer Institute in the summer 2017, after the campaign.In the atmosphere, methanesulfonic acid is produced by the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide that is mostly emitted in the atmosphere by phytoplankton. Methanesulfonic acid can contribute to the growth of aerosol particles by condensation or aqueous phase processing in clouds. The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel. Temporal coverage is from 22 January 2017 to 19 March 2017. There are no data for the first leg of the expedition because the instrument was not on the ship. The instrument was operated during leg 4 but data has not been processed yet as they require additional work due to some instrumental issues that affects their quality. Data were collected with one-second time resolution but integrated to five minutes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.Concentrations are reported as molecules per cubic centimeter. The lower limit of detection is in the ppq (part per quadrillion) range but was not determined exactly as it varies with the integration time and background noise.;"Baccarini, Andrea; Dommen, Josef; Gysel-Beer, Martin; Hartmann, Markus; Henning, Silvia; Lehtipalo, Katrianne; Schmale, Julia; Tummon, Fiona; Welti, André";10.5281/zenodo.2636771;2019-08-07T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/2636771#.XvWW8dXKFhE;Zenodo;Concentration of gaseous methanesulfonic acid measured over the Southern Ocean in the austral summer of 2016/2017, during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE);F9B5D838-A279-4469-B1C1-1B84E0A71BD6;169090

Numerical models are important tools for understanding the processes and feedbacks in the Earth system, including those involving changes in atmospheric CO2 (CO2,atm) concentrations. Here, we compile 55 published model studies (consisting of 778 individual simulations) that assess the impact of six forcing mechanisms on millennial-scale CO2,atm variations: changes in freshwater supply to the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, the strength and position of the southern-hemisphere westerlies, Antarctic sea ice extent, and aeolian dust fluxes. We generally find agreement on the direction of simulated CO2,atm change across simulations, but the amplitude of change is inconsistent, primarily due to the different complexities of the model representation of Earth system processes. When freshwater is added to the North Atlantic, a reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is generally accompanied by an increase in Southern Ocean- and Pacific overturning, reduced Antarctic sea ice extent, spatially varying export production, and changes in carbon storage in the Atlantic (rising), in other ocean basins (generally decreasing) and on land (more varied). Positive or negative CO2,atm changes are simulated during AMOC minima due to a spatially and temporally varying dominance of individual terrestrial and oceanic drivers (and compensating effects between them) across the different models. In contrast, AMOC recoveries are often accompanied by rising CO2,atm levels, which are mostly driven by ocean carbon release (albeit from different regions). The magnitude of simulated CO2,atm rise broadly scales with the duration of the AMOC perturbation (i.e., the stadial length). When freshwater is added to the Southern Ocean, reduced deep-ocean ventilation drives a CO2,atm drop via reduced carbon release from the Southern Ocean. Although the impacts of shifted southern-hemisphere westerlies are inconsistent across model simulations, their intensification raises CO2,atm via enhanced Southern Ocean Ekman pumping. Increased supply of aeolian dust to the ocean, and thus iron fertilisation of marine productivity, consistently lowers modelled CO2,atm concentrations via more efficient nutrient utilisation. The magnitude of CO2,atm change in response to dust flux variations, however, largely depends on the complexity of models' marine ecosystem and iron cycle. This especially applies to simulations forced by Antarctic sea ice changes, in which the direction of simulated CO2,atm change varies greatly across model hierarchies. Our compilation highlights that no single (forcing) mechanism can explain observed past millennial-scale CO2,atm variability, and identifies important future needs in coupled carbon cycle-climate modelling to better understand the mechanisms governing CO2,atm changes in the past.;"Battaglia, G.; Fischer, H.; Frölicher, T.L.; Gottschalk, J.; Jaccatd, S.L.; Jeltsch-Thömmes, A.; Joos, F.; Köhler, P.; Meissner, K.; Menviel, L.; Nehrbass-Ahles, C.; Schmitt, J.; Schmittner, A.; Skinner, L.C.; Stocker, T.F.";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.05.013.;2016-05-15T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.05.013;Quaternary Science reviews;Mechanisms of millennial-scale atmospheric CO2 change in numerical model simulations;0797D34C-74D5-424F-AA75-517559DBC2C5;172506

Dispersal is key for maintaining biodiversity at local- and regional scales in metacommunities. However, little is known about the combined effects of dispersal and climate change on biodiversity. Theory predicts that alpha-diversity is maximized at intermediate dispersal rates, resulting in a hump-shaped diversity-dispersal relationship. This relationship is predicted to flatten when competition increases. We anticipate that this same flattening will occur with increased temperature because, in the rising part of the temperature performance curve, interspecific competition is predicted to increase. We explored this question using aquatic communities of Sarracenia purpurea from early- and late-successional stages, in which we simulated four levels of dispersal and four temperature scenarios. With increased dispersal, the hump shape was observed consistently in late successional communities, but only in higher temperature treatments in early succession. Increased temperature did not flatten the hump-shape relationship, but decreased the level of alpha- and gamma-diversity. Interestingly, higher temperatures negatively impacted small-bodied species. These metacommunity-level extinctions likely relaxed interspecific competition, which could explain the absence of flattening of the diversity-dispersal relationship. Our findings suggest that climate change will cause extinctions both at local- and global- scales and emphasize the importance of intermediate levels of dispersal as an insurance for local diversity.;Parain, Elodie;10.5061/dryad.xpnvx0kbf;2020-01-06T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.xpnvx0kbf;Dryad;The effects of temperature and dispersal on species diversity in natural microbial metacommunities;92AC3D16-04A9-4754-909F-7F9C09B7A7AA;165800

Continuous records of the atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, CH4, and N2O are necessary input data for transient climate simulations and their related radiative forcing important components in analyses of climate sensitivity and feedbacks. Since the available data from ice cores are discontinuous and partly ambiguous a well-documented decision process during data compilation followed by some interpolating post-processing are necessary to obtain those desired time series. Here we document our best-guess data compilation of published ice core records and recent measurements on firn air and atmospheric samples covering the time window from the penultimate glacial maximum (approx. 156 kyr BP) to 2016 CE. A smoothing spline method is applied to translate the discrete and irregularly spaced data points into continuous time series. These splines are assumed to represent the evolution of the atmospheric mixing ratios for the three GHGs. Global-mean radiative forcing for each GHG is computed using well-established, simple formulations. Newest published age scales are used for the ice core data. While CO2 is representing an integrated global signal, we compile only a southern hemisphere record of CH4 and identify how much larger a northern hemisphere or global CH4 record might have been due to its interhemispheric gradient. Data resolution and uncertainties are considered in the spline procedure and typical cutoff periods, defining the degree of smoothing, range from 5000 years for the less resolved older parts of the records to 4 years for the densely-sampled recent years. The data sets describe seamlessly the GHG evolution on orbital and millennial time scales for glacial and glacial-interglacial variations and on centennial and decadal time scales for anthropogenic times.;"Fischer, H.; Köhler, P.; Nehrbass-Ahles, C.; Schmitt, J.; Stocker, T.F.";https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.871273;2017-07-20T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.871273;PANGAEA;Compilations and splined-smoothed calculations of continuous records of the atmospheric greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O and their radiative forcing since the penultimate glacial maximum;3948CB1B-823C-45DF-886E-521EF8A3D92C;172506
Atmospheric methane (CH4) records reconstructed from polar ice cores represent a integrated view on processes predominantly taking place in the terrestrial biogeosphere. Here we present dual stable isotopic methane records (d13CH4 and dD(CH4)) from four Antarctic ice cores, which provide improved constraints on past changes in natural methane sources. Our isotope data show that tropical wetlands and seasonally inundated floodplains are most likely the controlling sources of atmospheric methane variations for the current and two older interglacials and their preceding glacial maxima. The changes in these sources are steered by variations in temperature, precipitation and the water table, as modulated by insolation, (local) sea level and monsoon intensity. Based on our new dD(CH4) constraint, it appears that geologic emissions of methane may play a steady but only minor role in atmospheric CH4 changes, and that the glacial budget is not dominated by these sources. Superimposed on the glacial/interglacial variations is a marked difference in both isotope records, with systematically higher values during the last 25,000 years compared to older time periods. This shift cannot be explained by climatic changes. Rather, our isotopic methane budget points to a marked increase in fire activity, possibly due to biome changes and accumulation of fuel related to the late Pleistocene megafauna extinction, which took place in the course of the last glacial.;"Beck, J.; Bock, M.; Chappellaz, J.; Fischer, H.; Schmitt, J.; Seth, B.";https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.873918;2017-06-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.873918;PANGAEA;Dual stable isotopic methane (δ¹³CH4 and dD(CH4)) records from four Antarctic ice cores;281E21D4-D565-4738-8979-4E2BFEE03A20;172506

Three-dimensional nanometre-sized crystals of macromolecules currently resist structure elucidation by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Here, a single nanocrystal with a diffracting volume of only 0.14 µm 3 , i.e. no more than 6 × 10 5 unit cells, provided sufficient information to determine the structure of a rare dimeric polymorph of hen egg-white lysozyme by electron crystallography. This is at least an order of magnitude smaller than was previously possible. The molecular-replacement solution, based on a monomeric polyalanine model, provided sufficient phasing power to show side-chain density, and automated model building was used to reconstruct the side chains. Diffraction data were acquired using the rotation method with parallel beam diffraction on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope equipped with a novel in-house-designed 1024 × 1024 pixel Timepix hybrid pixel detector for low-dose diffraction data collection. Favourable detector characteristics include the ability to accurately discriminate single high-energy electrons from X-rays and count them, fast readout to finely sample reciprocal space and a high dynamic range. This work, together with other recent milestones, suggests that electron crystallography can provide an attractive alternative in determining biological structures.;Abrahams, Jan Pieter;5O4X;2017-08-23T00:00:00Z;http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?tabtoshow=Current&qrid=BB0D733;5O4X;Protein structure determination by electron diffraction using a single three-dimensional nanocrystal;A8CDB51A-C501-45E6-8674-4F4A93BBF01B;165669

1.    Urbanisation alters species richness and composition, but studies of urbanisation effects on ecological functions have often quantified variation in functional traits and changes in functional diversity rather than measuring directly how ecological functions vary between rural and urban assemblages.2.    Consuming dead animal matter and recycling its nutrients stabilizes and structures food webs and therefore represents a key component of ecosystem functioning. Introduction of free-ranging domestic pet animals adds additional scavenger species to urban habitats, and increased predictability of carcass resources produced by human activities characterizes urban habitats.3.    Here, we investigate the effect of urbanisation on the composition of diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages and on the ecological function of carcass removal by using a carcass placement experiment in Swiss urban and adjacent rural habitats.4.    While diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages changed considerably from rural to urban areas by comprising particularly more domestic cats in the latter, carrion consumption rate did not differ between the two habitats. Predictability of carcass occurrence increased carrion consumption rate in both, urban and rural habitats but mainly native scavengers and not introduced domestic pets responded to the repeated placements.5.    These results suggest that urbanisation shapes scavenger assemblage compositions without affecting their ecological function. The mechanism is likely due to a behavioural change of native scavengers in response to the occurrence of domestic pets resulting in functional plasticity of urban scavenger assemblages. The functional plasticity might be facilitated by the increased carcass predictability and additional anthropogenic food resources in urban habitats exploited by nutritionally flexible native scavenger species.;"Grüebler, Martin U.; Scherler, Patrick";https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.q83bk3jdb;2019-10-22T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash;Dryad;Data from: Carcass predictability but not domestic pet introduction affects functional response of scavenger assemblage in urbanised habitats;E5A6D146-B1A1-4AFA-B7FE-B4FE416C91AA;169668

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancers in men. Cancer stem cells are thought to be associated with PCa relapse. Here, we show that BAZ2A is required for PCa cells with a cancer stem-like state. BAZ2A genomic occupancy in PCa cells coincides with H3K14ac-enriched chromatin regions. This association is mediated by BAZ2A-bromodomain (BAZ2A-BRD) that specifically binds H3K14ac. BAZ2A associates with inactive enhancers marked by H3K14ac and repressing transcription of genes frequently silenced in aggressive and poorly differentiated PCa. BAZ2A-mediated repression is also linked to EP300 that acetylates H3K14ac. BAZ2A-BRD mutations or treatment with inhibitors abrogating BAZ2A-BRD/H3K14ac interaction impair PCa stem cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation of BAZ2A-BRD impairs Pten-loss oncogenic transformation of prostate organoids. Our findings indicate a role of BAZ2A-BRD in PCa stem cell features and suggest potential epigenetic-reader therapeutic strategies to target BAZ2A in aggressive PCa.;"Aprigliano, Rossana; Bizzarro, Juliana; Carina Frommel, Sandra; Lerra, Luigi; Peña‐Hernández, Rodrigo; Pietrzak, Karolina; Roganowicz, Marcin; Santoro, Raffaella; Steiger, Seraina";10.15252/embr.202153014;2021-08-17T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131268;Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);BAZ2A‐mediated repression via H3K14ac‐marked enhancers promotes prostate cancer stem cells;59D3E2E4-97B9-4ABF-BFA8-1A214AC09BBF;173056
Ground state naïve pluripotency is established in the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mature blastocyst and is present only transiently. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be derived at this stage and represent the immortalization of the pluripotent state by acquiring the capacity for infinite self-renewal. The precise molecular changes accompanying the arrest of the normal developmental program during ICM/ESC transition remain to be fully elucidated. Compared to ESCs, naïve pluripotency of ICM has been associated with global DNA hypomethylation and a generally low repressive epigenetic state that might serve for a greater flexibility to undergo rapid and transient phenotypic and developmental changes. Here we show that Pramel7 (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma-like 7), a protein exclusively expressed in ICM but present only at low levels in ESCs, functions as a substrate recognition component of the proteasome system by targeting degradation of UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains, 1), a key factor for the maintenance of DNA methylation. Enhancing the expression of Pramel7 in ESCs reduces UHRF1 levels, induces expression of ICM specific genes and causes global DNA hypomethylation. Expression of Pramel7 locks ESCs in pluripotency and destabilizes terminal differentiation by maintaining elevated expression of pluripotency genes through inhibition of de novo DNA methylation. Together, these findings reveal an as-yet-unappreciated dynamic nature of DNA methylation through the control of the proteasome pathway. Moreover, they offer important insights for the establishment of the unique epigenotype of naïve pluripotency that might help in establishing more physiological ESC culture conditions to in vitro reproduce the in vivo ground state pluripotency.;"Casanova, Elisa A.; Cinelli, Paolo; Dalcher, Damian; Gatti, Marco; Graf, Urs; Koseki, Haruhiko; Li, Jiwen; Okoniewski, Michal J.; Patel, Sameera S.; Pelczar, Pawel; Penengo, Lorenza; Santoro, Raffaella; Schmid, Marc W.; Sharif, Jafar; Vollenweider, Eva; Wanner, Guido A.; Weber, Fabienne A.; Wong, Jiemin; Wyck, Sarah";10.1038/ncb3554;2017-07-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB12665;ENA;Pramel7 mediates ground-state pluripotency through proteasomal–epigenetic combined pathways;8925DD3B-8FAA-43EE-90E7-1C1B4DC53978;173056
Chromosomes have an intrinsic tendency to segregate into compartments, forming long-distance contacts between loci of similar chromatin states. How genome compartmentalization is regulated remains elusive. Here, comparison of mouse ground-state embryonic stem cells (ESCs) characterized by open and active chromatin, and advanced serum ESCs with a more closed and repressed genome, reveals distinct regulation of their genome organization due to differential dependency on BAZ2A/TIP5, a component of the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC. On ESC chromatin, BAZ2A interacts with SNF2H, DNA topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) and cohesin. BAZ2A associates with chromatin subdomains within the active A compartment, which intersect through long-range contacts. We found that ground-state chromatin selectively requires BAZ2A to limit the invasion of active domains into repressive compartments. BAZ2A depletion increases chromatin accessibility at B compartments. Furthermore, BAZ2A regulates H3K27me3 genome occupancy in a TOP2A-dependent manner. Finally, ground-state ESCs require BAZ2A for growth, differentiation, and correct expression of developmental genes. Our results uncover the propensity of open chromatin domains to invade repressive domains, which is counteracted by chromatin remodeling to establish genome partitioning and preserve cell identity.;"Baubec, Tuncay; Bersaglieri, Cristiana; Bianchi, Valerio; Butz, Stefan; Dalcher, Damian; Kuzyakiv, Rostyslav; Marques, Ana Claudia; Peña‐Hernández, Rodrigo; Roganowicz, Marcin; Santoro, Raffaella; Schmid, Marc W; Tan, Jennifer Yihong; Vollenweider, Eva; Zeyen, Stefan";https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.2020105606;2020-10-20T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112222;NCBI’s GEO;BAZ 2A safeguards genome architecture of ground‐state pluripotent stem cells;CCACFA7F-4129-4178-8EE4-2248FB4031B2;173056

"We carried out DNA extraction, library preparation, and exome capture as described in Rellstab et al. (2019). Briefly, high-quality DNA of 20 trees per population was used to produce equimolar DNA pools for all 24 populations for pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq; Rellstab, Zoller, Tedder, Gugerli, & Fischer, 2013; Schlötterer, Tobler, Kofler, & Nolte, 2014), which has shown to yield accurate estimates of allele frequencies in this sequencing approach (Rellstab et al., 2019). We generated barcoded libraries (average insert size of 550 bp) using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, USA) and subsequently performed probe hybridisation using the MYcroarray myBaits Custom Capture Kit. The 24 hybridised libraries were then sequenced on four lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 4000 (paired-end reads of 150 bp) at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ, Zurich, Switzerland) and Fasteris (Geneva, Switzerland; Table S4).Following Rellstab et al. (2019), we trimmed and filtered raw reads with TRIMMOMATIC 0.35 (Bolger, Lohse, & Usadel, 2014) using a quality threshold of 20 on both forward and reverse reads. We then mapped the remaining reads back to those transcripts of the reference transcriptome that contained probe bases using BOWTIE 2.3.0 (Langmead, Trapnell, Pop, & Salzberg, 2009), and performed variant (i.e. SNP) and invariant site calling using GATK 3.8 (McKenna et al., 2010) with ploidy set to 40 (i.e. number of chromosomes sequenced per pool of 20 diploid individuals), a coverage ≥40×, and a mapping quality/depth ratio ≥0.25. To get rid of putatively paralogous genes, variant and invariant calling was carried out only for the 4,950 single-copy contigs as determined in Rellstab et al. (2019). These authors used HDplot (McKinney, Waples, Seeb, & Seeb, 2017) to exclude putatively paralogous contigs based on excess heterozygosity and deviation from usual allele balance (read ratio). To conduct population genetic analyses, we assembled a SNP set based on two additional filters to exclude weakly supported SNPs: excluding SNPs with (i) a minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤2.5% across populations (i.e. one chromosome in a pool) and (ii) missing data in at least one population.";"Brodbeck, Sabine; Dauphin, Benjamin; Fischer, Martin C.; Gugerli, Felix; Holderegger, Rolf; Rellstab, Christian; Wüest, Rafael O.; Zoller, Stefan";10.5061/dryad.9kd51 c5dr;2020-08-28T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.9kd51c5dr;Dryad;Data from: Disentangling the effects of geographic peripherality and habitat suitability on neutral and adaptive genetic variation in Swiss stone pine;D1D1BCD2-94EF-465C-8839-18C40B4137CB;152664
The ongoing increase in global temperature affects biodiversity, especially in mountain regions where climate change is exacerbated. As sessile, long-lived organisms, trees are especially challenged in terms of adapting to rapid climate change. Here, we show that low rates of allele frequency shifts in Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra) occurring near the treeline result in high genomic vulnerability to future climate warming, presumably due to the species’ long generation time. Using exome sequencing data from adult and juvenile cohorts in the Swiss Alps, we found an average rate of allele frequency shift of 1.23×10-2/generation (i.e. 40 years) at presumably neutral loci, with similar rates for putatively adaptive loci associated with temperature (0.96×10-2/generation) and precipitation (0.91×10-2/generation). These recent shifts were corroborated by forward-in-time simulations at neutral and adaptive loci. Additionally, in juvenile trees at the colonisation front we detected alleles putatively beneficial under a future warmer and drier climate. Notably, the observed past rate of allele frequency shift in temperature-associated loci was decidedly lower than the estimated average rate of 6.29×10-2/generation needed to match a moderate future climate scenario (RCP4.5). Our findings suggest that species with long generation times may have difficulty keeping up with the rapid climate change occurring in high mountain areas and thus are prone to local extinction in their current main elevation range.;"Brodbeck, Sabine; Dauphin, Benjamin; Gugerli, Felix; Guillaume, Frédéric; Karger, Dirk; Rellstab, Christian; Schmid, Max; Zoller, Stefan";10.5061/dryad.866t1g1pm;2020-12-14T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.866t1g1pm;Dryad;Data from: Genomic vulnerability to rapid climate warming in a tree species with a long generation time;51497039-3DCE-48B6-8A38-4C5746AFF278;152664
Aim: Knowing a species’ response to historical climate shifts helps understanding its perspectives under global warming. We infer the hitherto unresolved postglacial history of Pinus cembra. Using independent evidence from genetic structure and demographic inference of extant populations, and from palaeoecological findings, we derive putative refugia and re-colonisation routes.Location: European Alps and Carpathians.Taxa: Pinus cembra.Methods: We genotyped nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers in nearly 3,000 individuals from 147 locations across the entire natural range of P. cembra. Spatial genetic structure (Bayesian modelling) and demographic history (Approximate Bayesian Computation) were combined with palaeobotanical records (pollen, macrofossils) to infer putative refugial areas during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and re-colonisation of the current range.Results: We found distinct spatial genetic structure, despite low genetic differentiation even between the two disjunct mountain ranges. Nuclear markers revealed five genetic clusters aligned East-West across the range, while chloroplast haplotype distribution suggested nine clusters. Spatially congruent separation at both marker types highlighted two main genetic lineages in the East and West of the range. Demographic inference supported early separation of these lineages dating back to a previous interstadial or interglacial c. 210,000 years ago. Differentiation into five biologically meaningful genetic clusters likely established during post-glacial re-colonisation.Main conclusions: Combining genetic and palaeoecological evidence suggests that P. cembra primarily survived the LGM in “cold period” refugia south of the Central European Alps and near the Carpathians, from where it expanded during the Late Glacial into its current Holocene “warm period” refugia. This colonisation history has led to the distinct East-West structure of five genetic clusters. The two main genetic lineages likely derived from ancient divergence during an interglacial or interstadial. The respective contact zone (Brenner line) matches a main biogeographic break in the European Alps also found in herbaceous alpine plant species.;Gugerli, Felix;doi 10.5061/dryad.866t1g1v6;2023-02-20T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.866t1g1v6;Dryad;A range-wide postglacial history of Swiss stone pine based on molecular markers and palaeoecological evidence;2CC997A7-428B-4F19-9642-B67694C5CB4C;152664

Three-dimensional nanometre-sized crystals of macromolecules currently resist structure elucidation by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Here, a single nanocrystal with a diffracting volume of only 0.14 µm 3 , i.e. no more than 6 × 10 5 unit cells, provided sufficient information to determine the structure of a rare dimeric polymorph of hen egg-white lysozyme by electron crystallography. This is at least an order of magnitude smaller than was previously possible. The molecular-replacement solution, based on a monomeric polyalanine model, provided sufficient phasing power to show side-chain density, and automated model building was used to reconstruct the side chains. Diffraction data were acquired using the rotation method with parallel beam diffraction on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope equipped with a novel in-house-designed 1024 × 1024 pixel Timepix hybrid pixel detector for low-dose diffraction data collection. Favourable detector characteristics include the ability to accurately discriminate single high-energy electrons from X-rays and count them, fast readout to finely sample reciprocal space and a high dynamic range. This work, together with other recent milestones, suggests that electron crystallography can provide an attractive alternative in determining biological structures.;Abrahams, Jan Pieter;5O4W.pdb;2017-08-23T00:00:00Z;http://www.rcsb.org/structure/5O4W;5O4W.pdb;Protein structure determination by electron diffraction using a single three-dimensional nanocrystal;9A4075B0-8AC2-41FF-8BFB-05CDC57C9EAB;165669

These files contain data supporting all results reported in Quaglia, et al. (2022), . in Quaglia, et al, we found: Recent model inter-comparison studies highlighted model discrepancies in reproducing the climatic impacts of large explosive volcanic eruptions, calling into question the reliability of global aerosol model simulations for future scenarios. Here, we analyse the simulated evolution of the stratospheric aerosol plume following the well observed June 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption by six interactive stratospheric aerosol microphysics models in comparison to a range of observational data sets. Our primary focus is on the uncertainties regarding initial SO2 emission following the Pinatubo eruption in 1991, as prescribed in the Historical Eruptions SO2 Emission Assessment experiments (HErSEA), in the framework of the Interactive Stratospheric Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (ISA-MIP). Six global models with interactive aerosol microphysics took part in this study: ECHAM6-SALSA, EMAC, CHAM5-HAM, SOCOLAERv2, ULAQ-CCM and UM-UKCA. Model simulations are performed by varying SO2 injection amount (ranging between 5 and 10 Tg-S), and the altitude of injection (between 18-25 km). We find that the common and main weakness among all the models is that they can not reproduce the persistence of the sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere. Most models show a stronger transport towards the extratropics in the northern hemisphere, at the expense of the observed tropical confinement, suggesting a much weaker subtropical barrier in all the models, that results in a shorter e-folding time compared to the observations. Moreover, the simulations in which more than 5 Tg-S of SO2 are injected show a large surface area density a few months after the eruption compared to the values measured in the tropics and the in-situ measurements over Laramie. This results in an overestimation of the number of particles globally during the build-up phase, and an underestimation in the Southern Hemisphere, which draws attention to the importance of including processes as the ash injection and the eruption of Cerro Hudson.;Quaglia, Ilaria;https://doi.org/10.7298/MM1S-AE98;2022-11-22T00:00:00Z;https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/112209;ecommons.cornell.edu;Data from: Interactive Stratospheric Aerosol models response to different amount and altitude of SO₂ injections during the 1991 Pinatubo eruption;798A2750-8FFF-4CB8-995B-C2F27EAF8DED;182239

The database covers 14 advanced capitalist democracies between 1973 and 2013, and identifies a total of 4,953 reform policy changes (i.e., policy discontinuities) in the following 11 policy fields: active labor market policies (almp), competitive and product market regulation (comp), corporate governance (gov), employment protection legislation (epl), financial reform (fin), industrial relations (ir), non-employment benefits (neb), pension systems (pen), privatization (pri), tax policies (tax), and social security transfers and benefits (stb).Each entry (row) in the database comes with contextualizing information on a total of 28 variables, including the content and timing of a reform, its policy and sub-policy fields, the reform process, and the subjects involved in it, as well as the original data source and other meta data. Most importantly, the database provides an index of liberalization and another one of de-liberalization, which serve as measures of the incisiveness of each and every policy change. The construction of these indices is based on Peter Hall’s (1993) seminal work on policy changes as well as Baumgartner’s (2013) work on status quo changes.While the database’s unit of analysis is the individual reform, these data can easily be aggregated to obtain the liberalization/de-liberalization indices for each country-year or each country-year-policy-field.

Changes in chromosome numbers may strongly affect reproductive barriers, because individuals heterozygous for distinct karyotypes are typically expected to be at least partially sterile or to show reduced recombination. Therefore, several classic speciation models are based on chromosomal changes. One import mechanism generating variation in chromosome numbers is fusion and fission of existing chromosomes, which is particularly likely in species with holocentric chromosomes, i.e. chromosomes that lack a single centromere. Holocentric chromosomes evolved repeatedly across the tree of life, including in Lepidoptera . Although changes in chromosome numbers are hypothesized to be an important driver of the spectacular diversification of Lepidoptera, comparative studies across the order are lacking. We performed the first comprehensive literature survey of karyotypes for Lepidoptera species since the 1970s and tested if, and how, chromosomal variation might affect speciation. Even though a meta-analysis of karyological differences between closely related taxa did not reveal an effect on the degree of reproductive isolation, phylogenetic diversification rate analyses across the 16 best-covered genera indicated a strong, positive association of rates of chromosome number evolution and speciation. These findings suggest a macroevolutionary impact of varying chromosome numbers in Lepidoptera and likely apply to other taxonomic groups, especially to those with holocentric chromosomes. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers’.;"Augustijnen, Hannah; Bätscher, Livio; de Vos, Jurriaan M.; Lucek, Kay";"  10.5281/zenodo.3735954";2020-08-31T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3735954;Zenodo;Speciation through chromosomal fusion and fission in Lepidoptera;28B7A310-CE10-4FB4-97A2-C28FD89E9FE5;184934

Understanding how to program biological functions into artificial DNA sequences remains a key challenge in synthetic genomics. Here, we report the chemical synthesis and testing of Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 ( C. eth-2.0 ), a rewritten bacterial genome composed of the most fundamental functions of a bacterial cell. We rebuilt the essential genome of Caulobacter crescentus through the process of chemical synthesis rewriting and studied the genetic information content at the level of its essential genes. Within the 785,701-bp genome, we used sequence rewriting to reduce the number of encoded genetic features from 6,290 to 799. Overall, we introduced 133,313 base substitutions, resulting in the rewriting of 123,562 codons. We tested the biological functionality of the genome design in C. crescentus by transposon mutagenesis. Our analysis revealed that 432 essential genes of C. eth-2.0 , corresponding to 81.5% of the design, are equal in functionality to natural genes. These findings suggest that neither changing mRNA structure nor changing the codon context have significant influence on biological functionality of synthetic genomes. Discovery of 98 genes that lost their function identified essential genes with incorrect annotation, including a limited set of 27 genes where we uncovered noncoding control features embedded within protein-coding sequences. In sum, our results highlight the promise of chemical synthesis rewriting to decode fundamental genome functions and its utility toward the design of improved organisms for industrial purposes and health benefits.;"Appert, Donat; Bucher, Yves; Christen, Beat; Christen, Matthias; Del Medico, Luca; Deutsch, Samuel; Flores-Tinoco, Carlos E.; Guennoun, Rym; Schächle, Philipp; Tschan, Flavia; van Kooten, Mariëlle; Venetz, Jonathan E.; Wölfle, Alexander";pnas.1818259116.sd02;2019-04-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.pnas.org/highwire/filestream/857873/field_highwire_adjunct_files/1/pnas.1818259116.sd02.xlsx;PNAS;Data_S02;965B9A4F-1256-497F-9D64-CDD2B15B9291;166476

This dataset provides friction data from ring-shear tests (RST) for a quartz sand (“A”). This material is used in various types of analogue experiments in Tectonic Modelling Lab of the University of Bern as an analogue for brittle layers in the crust or lithosphere. The material has been characterized by means of internal friction coefficients μ and cohesions C. Three sub-datasets represent a systematic increase of the sieving height from 10 cm to 20 cm to 30 cm into a shear cell of type No. 1, following the same protocol. This dataset shows that packing density of quartz sand is dependent on the chosen sieving height. However, the effect of the sieving height on internal friction coefficients μ as well as cohesion C is minor and thus negligible in sandbox experiments. According to our analysis the material shows for a sieving height of 10 cm a Mohr-Coulomb behaviour characterized by a linear failure envelope and peak, dynamic and reactivation friction coefficients of μP = 0.70, μD = 0.60 and μR = 0.65, respectively. Cohesions C are in the order of 40 - 80 Pa.;"Rosenau, Matthias; Schmid, Timothy; Schreurs, Guido; Warsitzka, M.";10.5880/fidgeo.2020.006;2020-02-14T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2020.006;GFZ Data Services;Effect of Sieving Height on Density and Friction of Brittle Analogue Material: Ring-shear Test Data of Quarz Sand Used for Analogue Experiments in the Tectonic Modelling Lab of the University of Bern;30F3D3F1-A043-443B-9A73-D1CC9769CB8C;178731
This data set includes videos depicting the surface evolution (time-lapse photographs and Particle Image Velocimetry or PIV analysis) of 38 analogue models, in five model series (A-E), simulating rift tectonics. In these experiments we examined the influence of differently oriented mantle and crustal weaknesses on rift system development during multiphase rifting (i.e. rifting involving changing divergence directions or -rates) using brittle-viscous set-ups. All experiments were performed at the Tectonic Modelling Laboratory of the University of Bern (UB).The brittle and viscous layers, representing the upper an lower crust, were 3 cm and 1 cm thick, respectively, whereas a mantle weakness was simulated using the edge of a moving basal plate (a velocity discontinuity or VD). Crustal weaknesses were simulated using “seeds” (ridges of viscous material at the base of the brittle layers that locally weaken these brittle layers). The divergence rate for the Model A reference models was 20 mm/h so that the model duration of 2:30 h yielded a total divergence of 5 cm (so that e = 17%, given an initial model width of ca. 30 cm). Multiphase rifting model series B and C involved both a slow (10 mm/h) and fast (100 mm/h) rifting phase of 2.5 cm divergence each, for a total of 5 cm of divergence over a 2:45 h period. Multiphase rifting models series D and E had the same divergence rates (20 mm/h) as the Series A reference models, but involved both an orthogonal (α = 0˚) and oblique rifting (α = 30˚) phase of 2.5 cm divergence each, for a total of 5 cm of divergence over a 2:30 h period. In our models the divergence obliquity angle α was defined as the angle between the normal to the central model axis and the direction of divergence. The orientation and arrangements of the simulated mantle and crustal weaknesses is defined by angle θ (defined as the direction of the weakness with respect to the model axis.

This dataset shows that packing density of corundum sand is dependent on the chosen sieving height. However, the effect of the sieving height on internal friction coefficients μ as well as cohesion C is minor and thus negligible in sandbox experiments. According to our analysis the material shows for a sieving height of 10 cm a Mohr-Coulomb behaviour characterized by a linear failure envelope and peak, dynamic and reactivation friction coefficients of μP = 0.75, μD = 0.64 and μR = 0.68, respectively. Cohesions C are in the order of 70 - 105 Pa.;"Rosenau, Matthias; Schmid, Timothy; Schreurs, Guido; Warsitzka, M.";10.5880/fidgeo.2020.005;2020-02-14T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2020.005;GFZ Data Services;Effect of Sieving Height on Density and Friction of Brittle Analogue Material: Ring-shear Test Data of Corundum Sand Used for Analogue Experiments in the Tectonic Modelling Lab of the University of Be;5C4C4B24-96C2-408D-888A-7ABA605798DF;178731
This dataset includes surface 3D stereoscopic Digital Image Correlation (3D stereo DIC) images and videos of 9 analogue models on crustal scale rifting with a rotational component. Using a brittle-viscous two-layer setup, the experiments focused on near-surface fault growth, rift segment interaction and rift propagation. All experiments were performed at the Tectonic Modelling Laboratory of the University of Bern (UB).All models consist of a two-layer brittle-viscous set up with a total thickness of 6 cm. Thickness variations in ductile and brittle layers are expressed by the ratio RBD = brittle layer thickness/ductile layer thickness, which ranges from RBD = 1 to RBD = 3. The model set up lies on top of a 5 cm thick foam base with a trapezoidal shape with a height of 900 mm and a pair of bases of 310 mm and 350 mm. The foam block is sliced into segments such that 7 interlayered 0.5 cm thick plexiglass bars prevent foam collapse under the model weight. The foam base is initially compressed between the longitudinal side walls and homogeneously expands during the rotational opening. Applied velocities refer to the divergence of the sidewalls at the outermost point (i.e., furthest away from the rotation axis) and decrease linearly towards the rotation axis. These velocities vary from 10 mm/h over a total run time of 4 h up to 40 mm/h over a total run time of one hour, resulting in identical total extension of ca 13% (given an initial model width of 31 cm) for all models. Detailed descriptions of the experiments as well as monitoring techniques can be found in Schmid et al. (2021).;"Adam, Jürgen; Rosenau, Matthias; Rudolf,  Michael; Schmid, Timothy; Schreurs, Guido";10.5880/fidgeo.2021.048;2021-02-14T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2021.048;GFZ Data Services;3D stereo DIC data from analogue models exploring fault growth and rift propagation in rotational rift systems;7036252D-8252-4473-AFEA-7345C77C3321;178731

Moiré superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers provide a platform for exploring strong correlations with optical spectroscopy. Despite the observation of rich Mott-Wigner physics stemming from an interplay between the periodic potential and Coulomb interactions, the absence of tunnel coupling-induced hybridization of electronic states has ensured a classical layer degree of freedom. We investigated a MoSe2 homobilayer structure where interlayer coherent tunneling allows for electric field-controlled manipulation and measurement of the ground-state hole-layer pseudospin. We observed an electrically tunable two-dimensional Feshbach resonance in exciton-hole scattering, which allowed us to control the strength of interactions between excitons and holes located in different layers. Our results may enable the realization of degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions.;"Imamoglu, Atac; Kroner, Martin; Kuhlenkamp, Clemens; Schwartz, Ido; Shimazaki, Yuya; Taniguchi, Takashi; Watanabe, Kenji";10.3929/ethz-b-000482685;2021-10-15T00:00:00Z;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/482685;Research Collection;Electrically tunable Feshbach resonances in twisted bilayer semiconductors;9A729ADC-CE9F-4679-91B9-C8B141E594BF;178909

"Stable isotope ratios from tree rings are important proxies of past climate variations. We have access to a calendar-dated wood material from wood collected at glacier forefields and peat bog sites located in the Alps. They are of two species, larch (Larix decidua) and cembran pine (Pinus cembra). All the wood samples were collected at high altitudes in the Swiss and Tyrol Alps, they cover the whole Holocene period and belong to the Eastern Alpine Conifer Chronology Dataset (Nicolussi et al., 2009; doi:10.1177/0959683609336565). We analysed the δ13C, δ18O and δ2H isotope ratios of alpha cellulose obtained from blocks of 5 annual rings from 203 trees. Cellulose was extracted following the modified Jayme-Wise method (Boettger et al., 2007; doi:10.1021/ac0700023). The isotopes values were determined using conventional Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (Isoprime 100) coupled to a pyrolysis unit (HEKAtech GmbH, Germany), which is similar to the previously used TC/EA (for technical details see (Leuenberger 2007). This approach was extended to measurements of non-exchangeable hydrogen of alpha-cellulose using the on-line equilibration method (Filot et al., 2006 (doi:10.1002/rcm.2743); Loader et al., 2015(doi:10.1021/ac502557x)). The results are reported in per mil (‰) relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) for carbon and to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) for hydrogen and oxygen (Coplen 1994; doi:10.1351/pac199466020273). For all the δ13C values after 1000 CE we applied the factor described in Leuenberger (2007; doi:10.1016/S1936-7961(07)01014-7) to correct for the δ13C depletion of CO2 caused by the Industrial Revolution from about 1850 onwards (Leuenberger, 2007).";"Arosio, Tito; Leuenberger, Markus; Nicolussi, Kurt; Nyfeler, Peter; Österreicher, Andreas; Schlüchter, Christian; Thurner, Andrea; Ziehmer, Malim";https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.941604 ((dataset in review));2022-03-30T00:00:00Z;https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.941604;PANGAEA;Alpine Holocene Triple Tree Ring Isotope Record;A00FD6A2-2270-46BD-9ACE-44BFE31A9AFE;172550

The contextual appropriateness collection consists of 1,969 pairs of trip descriptors and venue categories as features. In order to enable researchers to train their models using the contextual appropriateness of venues, we created another collection providing ground truth assessments for the contextual appropriateness of the venue categories. It completes the contextual information (i.e., trip type, group type, trip duration) for 10% of the whole TREC collection. This collection contains 760 rows including the features we already created using crowdsourcing and the context-appropriateness labels for venues. The 10% of labeled data allows to model the venues’ contextual appropriateness given the users’ context and to make prediction for the remaining 90% of the data. Below, you can see a histogram of venue-context appropriateness score ranges. We partition the histogram into 3 parts based on the scores range. Scores below −0.4 represent inappropriateness and score higher than +0.4 represent appropriateness. Scores between −0.4 and +0.4 do not provide much information and show no agreement among assessors (subjective task).;"Aliannejadi, Mohammad; Crestani, Fabio; Mele, Ida";10.1145/3077136.3080752;2017-08-07T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/aliannejadi/contextual-appropriateness;contextual-appropriateness;TREC-CS Appropriateness;34F45092-5E30-44A1-A954-CD8DD6B7313B;156864

The authors would highly appreciate being contacted if the data is used for any purpose.We measured sulfuric acid concentration in the gas phase with a nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometer (we used an APi-HTOF mass spectrometer produced by Tofwerk AG coupled with a Chemical ionization inlet A70 produced by Airmodus). Sulfuric acid is detected in the mass spectrometer either as a deprotonated ion or as a cluster with the reagent ion (NO3-). The concentration is calculated as the area of these two peaks normalized to the concentration of the reagent ions (monomer, dimer and trimer) and multiplied by a calibration factor that was experimentally derived at Paul Scherrer Institute in the summer 2017, after the campaign. In the atmosphere, sulfuric acid is produced by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide that could have both a natural or anthropogenic origin (e.g. phytoplankton emission or fossil fuel combustion). Sulfuric acid in the atmosphere is responsible for a very large fraction of the newly formed particles, therefore it is important to have accurate measurements of this vapour in remote places like the Southern Ocean to better understand secondary aerosol sources and processes.The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel. Temporal coverage is from January 22, 2017 to March 19, 2017. There are no data for the first leg of the expedition because the instrument was not on the ship. The instrument was operated during leg 4 but data has not been processed yet as they require additional work due to some instrumental issues that affects their quality. Data were collected with one-second time resolution but integrated to five minutes to increase the signal to noise ratio.Concentrations are reported as molecules per cubic centimeter. The lower limit of detection is in the ppq (part per quadrillion) range but was not determined exactly as it varies with the integration time and background noise.;"Baccarini, Andrea; Dommen, Josef; Gysel-Beer, Martin; Hartmann, Markus; Henning, Silvia; Lehtipalo, Katrianne; Schmale, Julia; Tummon, Fiona; Welti, André";10.5281/zenodo.3265832;2019-08-07T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3265832#.XvWXp9XKFhE;Zenodo;Concentration of gaseous sulfuric acid measured over the Southern Ocean in the austral summer of 2016/2017, during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE);64CDAF1A-267B-44C5-A908-7516CA45B752;169090

Gaining knowledge of how ecosystems provide essential services to humans is of primary importance, especially with the current threat of climate change. Yet, little is known about how increased temperature will impact the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship. We tackled this subject theoretically and experimentally. We developed a BEF theory based on mechanistic population dynamic models, which allows the inclusion of the effect of temperature. Using experimentally established relationships between attack rate and temperature, the model predicts that temperature increase will intensify competition and consequently the BEF relationship will flatten or even become negative. We conducted a laboratory experiment with natural microbial microcosms and the results were in agreement with the model predictions. The experimental results also revealed that an increase of both temperature average and variation had a more intense effect than an increase of temperature average alone. Our results indicate that, under climate change, high diversity may not guarantee high ecosystem functioning.;Parain, Elodie;10.5061/dryad.hk1h26n;2018-10-03T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.hk1h26n;Dryad;Data from: Increased temperature disrupts the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship;7A2C0368-8FB2-442C-9434-0606E509E4ED;165800

Understanding how to program biological functions into artificial DNA sequences remains a key challenge in synthetic genomics. Here, we report the chemical synthesis and testing of Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 ( C. eth-2.0 ), a rewritten bacterial genome composed of the most fundamental functions of a bacterial cell. We rebuilt the essential genome of Caulobacter crescentus through the process of chemical synthesis rewriting and studied the genetic information content at the level of its essential genes. Within the 785,701-bp genome, we used sequence rewriting to reduce the number of encoded genetic features from 6,290 to 799. Overall, we introduced 133,313 base substitutions, resulting in the rewriting of 123,562 codons. We tested the biological functionality of the genome design in C. crescentus by transposon mutagenesis. Our analysis revealed that 432 essential genes of C. eth-2.0 , corresponding to 81.5% of the design, are equal in functionality to natural genes. These findings suggest that neither changing mRNA structure nor changing the codon context have significant influence on biological functionality of synthetic genomes. Discovery of 98 genes that lost their function identified essential genes with incorrect annotation, including a limited set of 27 genes where we uncovered noncoding control features embedded within protein-coding sequences. In sum, our results highlight the promise of chemical synthesis rewriting to decode fundamental genome functions and its utility toward the design of improved organisms for industrial purposes and health benefits.;"Appert, Donat; Bucher, Yves; Christen, Beat; Christen, Matthias; Del Medico, Luca; Deutsch, Samuel; Flores-Tinoco, Carlos E.; Guennoun, Rym; Schächle, Philipp; Tschan, Flavia; van Kooten, Mariëlle; Venetz, Jonathan E.; Wölfle, Alexander";pnas.1818259116.sd01;2019-04-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.pnas.org/highwire/filestream/857873/field_highwire_adjunct_files/1/pnas.1818259116.sd01.xlsx;PNAS;Data_S01;21A431D3-321A-464F-9C5B-3A25FDEB21ED;166476

In sum, our results highlight the promise of chemical synthesis rewriting to decode fundamental genome functions and its utility toward the design of improved organisms for industrial purposes and health benefits.;"Christen, Beat; Christen, Matthias; Venetz, Jonathan";CP035535;2019-04-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP035535;NCBI, GenBank;Synthetic Caulobacter sp.

Through software visualization developers can augment their capabilities to analyze multiple aspects of complex software systems. However, not every software visualization is suitable to tackle a given development concern. To understand how effective a software visualization is, it must be evaluated on that particular development task. We present an overview of the evaluation of existing visualizations, and examine their characteristics. In particular, we review the complete literature body of papers published in the SOFTVIS/VISSOFT conferences. Among the 387 papers published to date, we included in our study 181 full papers from which we extracted evaluation strategies, data collection methods and other various aspects of the evaluations. We found that 62% of the proposed software visualization approaches do not include an evaluation. We believe that for software visualization approaches to be adopted by developers, visualizations not only must prove their effectiveness via evaluations, but also evaluations should include participants of the target audience and real-world software systems. Finally, we recommend researchers in the field to conduct surveys that can help them to identify what are the frequent and complex problems that affect developers.;Merino, Leonel;http://scg.unibe.ch/research/softvis-eval;;http://scg.unibe.ch/research/softvis-eval;A Systematic Literature Review of Software Visualization Evaluation;A Systematic Literature Review of Software Visualization Evaluation;0EBC850C-EA3B-44B4-B11A-0A2CD0409CBD;162352

"The authors would highly appreciate to be contacted if the data is used for any purpose.We measured sub-micrometer aerosol particles with two scanning mobility particle spectrometers (SMPSs) between 11 and 400 nm (file name ACESPACE_submicron_aerosol_particle_size_distribution.csv) in 100 bins, and 11 and 181 nm in 77 bins - so no data entry in the remaining 23 bins - (ACESPACE_submicron_aerosol_particle_size_distribution_nano.csv) at a time resolution of five minutes during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Particles in this size range are important for cloud formation because a sub-set of them can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).The time series of the size distribution shows that the particle population over the Southern Ocean can be quite variable featuring three dominant modes: a new particle formation mode (11 - 30 nm); an Aitken mode (20 - 70 nm); and an accumulation mode (> 70 nm). Often a concentration minimum between the Aitken and accumulation mode can be observed. It is known as Hoppel minimum (Hoppel and Frick, 1990; 10.1016/0960-1686(90)90020-N). Typically, particles larger than this minimum act as CCN. The variability of the particle size spectrum is a result of particle sources and atmospheric processes. Sea spray generation adds larger particles likely with a peak in the mode around 200 nm. Trace gas emissions from microbial communities in the ocean, such as dimethylsulfide (DMS) will be oxidized to either sulphuric acid or methanesulfonic acid in the atmosphere which condense onto pre-existing particles, hence growing those. Sulphuric acid can also form new particles (new particle formation mode). Rain and snow will remove particles larger than the Hoppel minimum.The data set can be used to explore the variability of the particle size distribution in three different oceans around Antarctica (Indian, Pacific, Atlantic Oceans) and from Cape Town to Europe in relation to weather patterns, air mass trajectories, microbial activity etc. It is best used in combination with CCN data to explore the importance of particles for cloud formation. This data set cannot be used to unambiguously determine sources of particles over the southern ocean or to trace anthropogenic impact in the region.The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel.We give five-minute average data as dN/dlog(dp), where dN is the particle number concentration per measured size bin normalized over the logarithm of the bin width. The bin width is defined as the distance between two diameters. They are spaced equally in log-space with dlog(dp) = log(d_n+1/d_n) = 1/64. To derive the total particle number concentration between 11 and 400 nm one has to integrate over the diameter range taking into account the normalization by dlog(dp).Temporal coverage is from December 20, 2016 to April 10, 2017. The file “ACESPACE_submicron_aerosol_particle_size_distribution.csv” covers the entire time period except between 9 and 14 January 2017 due to instrument issues. The file “ACESPACE_submicron_aerosol_particle_size_distribution_nano.csv” contains data for the period between 9 and 14 January 2017 and can be used to fill the above gap. The second data file stems from another SMPS with a smaller differential mobility analyser, hence the smaller diameter coverage.";"Baccarini, Andrea; Gysel-Beer, Martin; Hartmann, Markus; Henning, Silvia; Lehtipalo, Katrianne; Schmale, Julia; Tatzelt, Christian; Tummon, Fiona; Welti, André";10.5281/zenodo.2636700;2020-06-18T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/2636700#.XvWaq9XKFhE;Zenodo;Sub-micron aerosol particle size distribution collected in the Southern Ocean in the austral summer of 2016/2017, during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition;4E0E283D-EB58-4905-9BE4-9FC78F120008;169090

Abstract Integrated photonics facilitates extensive control over fundamental light-matter interactions in manifold quantum systems including atoms 1 , trapped ions 2,3 , quantum dots 4 and defect centres 5 . Ultrafast electron microscopy has recently made free-electron beams the subject of laser-based quantum manipulation and characterization 6-11 , enabling the observation of free-electron quantum walks 12-14 , attosecond electron pulses 10,15-17 and holographic electromagnetic imaging 18 . Chip-based photonics 19,20 promises unique applications in nanoscale quantum control and sensing but remains to be realized in electron microscopy. Here we merge integrated photonics with electron microscopy, demonstrating coherent phase modulation of a continuous electron beam using a silicon nitride microresonator. The high-finesse ( Q0 ≈ 10 6 ) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching lead to efficient electron-light scattering at extremely low, continuous-wave optical powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial electron state at a cavity-coupled power of only 5.35 microwatts and generate >500 electron energy sidebands for several milliwatts. Moreover, we probe unidirectional intracavity fields with microelectronvolt resolution in electron-energy-gain spectroscopy 21 . The fibre-coupled photonic structures feature single-optical-mode electron-light interaction with full control over the input and output light. This approach establishes a versatile and highly efficient framework for enhanced electron beam control in the context of laser phase plates 22 , beam modulators and continuous-wave attosecond pulse trains 23 , resonantly enhanced spectroscopy 24-26 and dielectric laser acceleration 19,20,27 . Our work introduces a universal platform for exploring free-electron quantum optics 28-31 , with potential future developments in strong coupling, local quantum probing and electron-photon entanglement.;"Arend, Germaine; Feist, Armin; Henke, Jan-Wilke; Huang, Guanhao; Kappert, F.

SignificanceVaccines against persisting viruses such as HIV or hepatitis C virus remain a significant unmet global need. Long-lived memory B cells can be induced by vaccination to form an important pillar of antiviral immunity, yet persisting viruses subvert both primary B cell responses and memory B cell protection. Studying a mouse model of persistent viral infection, we found that CD4 T memory cells averted the deletion of antiviral B cells upon chronic virus challenge. Memory T help promoted germinal center reactions, preventing the B cells’ untimely, interferon-induced end differentiation. These observations indicate that B cell-based vaccination should be paired with potent memory CD4 T cell induction for memory B cells to prevail when confronted with a chronic viral intruder.;"Abreu Mota, Tiago; Bestmann, Lukas; Brunner, Tobias M.; Cornille, Karen; Dimitrova, Mirela; Ertuna, Yusuf I.; Fallet, Benedict; Geier, Florian; King, Carolyn G.; Kreutzfeldt, Mario; Künzli, Marco; Löhning, Max; Martin, Katrin; Marx, Anna-Friederike; Merkler, Doron; Narr, Kerstin; Pinschewer, Daniel D.; Schreiner, David; Wagner, Ingrid";10.1073/pnas.2108157118;2021-11-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5203142;Gene Expression Omnibus;Vaccine-elicited CD4 T cells prevent the deletion of antiviral B cells in chronic infection;6CB844E5-FEE5-4500-93E3-C61325A5FE18;173010

DescriptionFor the release of a slab avalanche, crack propagation within a weak snowpack layer below a cohesive snow slab is required. As crack speed measurements can give insight into the underlying processes, we analysed three crack propagation events that occurred in similar snowpacks and covered all scales relevant for avalanche release. For the largest scale, up to 400 m, we estimated crack speed from an avalanche movie, for scales between 5 and 25 meters, we used accelerometers placed on the snow surface, and for scales below 5 meters, we performed a Propagation Saw Test. The mean crack speeds ranged from 36 ± 6 to 49 ± 5 m s^{-1}, and did not exhibit scale dependence. Using the Discrete Element Method and the Material Point Method, we reproduced the measured crack speeds reasonably well, in particular the terminal crack speed observed at smaller scales. This dataset includes raw data as well as crack speed estimates from the three crack propagation events. Where possible, we reproduced these field experiments with numerical models based on Discrete Element Method (DEM, Bobillier and others, 2020 and 2021) and Material Point Method (MPM. Gaume and others, 2018 and Trottet and others, 2021). The input parameters of the models were estimated from the corresponding snow profiles conducted at each test site.The raw data include:    Propagation Saw Test movie with mechanical fields derived from Digital image Correlation analysis of the recording    Acceleration data recorded with wireless time synchronized accelerometers placed on the snow surface during crack propagation in a whumpf. *Video of an artificially triggered avalanche with widespread crack propagation. The video was used to georeference surface cracks in order to estimate crack propagation time and distance, providing crack propagation speed estimates.    Snow profile recorded at each test siteExperimental crack speed estimates include:    Crack speed evolution within the first meters derived from the Propagation Saw Test.    Crack speeds estimated from the time delay of the collapse, observed between different accelerometers during crack propagation of a whumpf.    Crack speed estimates from video analysis of the artificially triggered avalanche.Reproduced crack speeds using the DEM an MPM model:    Modelled Propagation Saw Test using MPM (2D and 3D system) and DEM.

We determine the band alignment at the CaF2/Si(111) interface through various advanced electronic-structure methods. This interface is experimentally well-studied and serves as an ideal test case to examine the accuracy of theoretical schemes. We use both global and range-separated hybrid functionals as well as GW calculations including self-consistency and vertex corrections. Our calculation procedure accounts for residual strain resulting from the small mismatch in the lateral lattice constants at the interface to minimize the systematic error in the comparison with experiment. Both the hybrid-functional and the GW schemes give band alignments in overall good agreement with the experimental characterization. However, the considered methods yield sizable variations in the calculated band offsets, which do not originate from incorrect evaluations of the band gaps but rather from different inherent relative positions of the band edges. The comparison with experiment reveals that the global hybrid functional and the quasiparticle self-consistent GW with vertex corrections give the most accurate description of the band alignment. We then determine the variation of the band offsets as a function of the amount of excess fluorine at the interface and attribute the experimental spread in the measured offsets to uncontrolled fluorine contamination.;Bischoff, Thomas;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:m4-by;2020-07-13T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2020.74;Materials Cloud;Band alignment at the CaF2/Si(111) interface through advanced electronic structure calculations;67371A5A-7CC9-461C-B98A-CEF4901FE424;172524
Nonempirical hybrid functionals are investigated for band-gap predictions of inorganic metal-halide perovskites belonging to the class CsBX3 , with B = Ge, Sn, Pb and X = Cl, Br, I. We consider both global and range-separated hybrid functionals and determine the parameters through two different schemes. The first scheme is based on the static screening response of the material and thus yields dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals. The second scheme defines the hybrid functionals through the enforcement of Koopmans’ condition for localized defect states. We also carry out quasiparticle self-consistent GW calculations with vertex corrections to establish state-of-the-art references. For the investigated class of materials, dielectric-dependent functionals and those fulfilling Koopmans’ condition yield band gaps of comparable accuracy (∼0.2 eV), but the former only require calculations for the primitive unit cell and are less subject to the specifics of the material.;Bischoff, Thomas;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:2020.0003/v1;2020-01-07T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2020.0003/v1;Materials Cloud;Nonempirical hybrid functionals for band gaps of inorganic metal-halide perovskites;10DF2DB5-ABCD-4A80-9095-C4E98A7074FB;172524

Endocrine data from wild populations provide important insight into social systems. However, obtaining samples for traditional methods involves capture and restraint of animals, and/or pain, which can influence the animal’s stress level, and thereby undesirable release of hormones. Here, we measured corticosterone, testosterone and progesterone in the hair of 482 wild-derived house mice that experienced sexual competition while living under semi-natural conditions. We tested whether sex, age, weight and indicators of sexual maturity, reproduction and social conflicts predict hormone concentrations measured in hair (sampling at endpoint). We show that body weight, sex and age significantly predict cumulative testosterone and progesterone levels, allowing the differentiation between subadults and adults in both sexes. Corticosterone was only slightly elevated in older males compared to older females and increased with the level of visible injuries or scars. Testosterone in males positively correlated with body weight, age, testes size, and sperm number. Progesterone in females significantly increased with age, body weight, and the number of embryos implanted throughout life, but not with the number of litters when controlled for age and weight. Our results highlight the biological validity of hair steroid measurements and provide important insight into reproductive competition in wild house mice.;"Carlitz, Esther H.

Bile acids control lipid homeostasis by regulating uptake from food and excretion. Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids.

Bile acids control lipid homeostasis by regulating uptake from food and excretion. Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common diseases associated with pregnancy, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Based on the well documented role of inflammation in type 2 diabetes, the aim was to investigate the role of inflammation in GDM. We established a mouse model for GDM on the basis of its two major risk factors, obesity and aging. In these GDM mice, we observed increased Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression in the uterus and the placenta along with elevated circulating IL-1β concentrations compared to normoglycemic pregnant mice. Treatment with an anti-IL-1β antibody improved glucose-tolerance of GDM mice without apparent deleterious effects for the fetus. Finally, IL-1β antagonism showed a tendency for reduced plasma corticosterone concentrations, possibly explaining the metabolic improvement. We conclude that IL-1β is a causal driver of impaired glucose tolerance in GDM.;"Böni-Schnetzler, Marianne; Dalmas, Elise; De Baat, Axel; Donath, Marc Y; Dror, Erez; Häuselmann, Stéphanie P; Kratschmar, Denise V; Makshana, Valmir; Meier, Daniel T; Nordmann, Thierry M; Odermatt, Alex; Rachid, Leila; Rohm, Theresa V; Schulze, Friederike; Thienel, Constanze; Traub, Shuyang; Wehner, Josua; Wiedemann, Sophia J; Zhao, Cheng";10.5281/zenodo.5509903;2020-03-20T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5509903;Zenodo;Data_Fig5_Inhibition of IL-1beta improves Glycaemia in a Mouse Model for Gestational Diabetes;CD6396F9-7DEB-493B-819B-1E3DD45935BF;179400

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Steroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1) plays important role in hepatic bile acid synthesis and glucocorticoid clearance. Bile acids and glucocorticoids are potent metabolic regulators, but whether AKR1D1 controls metabolic phenotype in vivo is unknown. Akr1d1-/- mice were generated on a C57BL/6 background. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to determine effects on glucocorticoid and bile acid homeostasis. Metabolic phenotypes including body weight and composition, lipid homeostasis, glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were evaluated. Molecular changes were assessed by RNA-Seq and Western blotting. Male Akr1d1-/- mice were challenged with a high fat diet (60% kcal from fat) for 20 weeks. Akr1d1-/- mice had a sex-specific metabolic phenotype. At 30 weeks of age, male, but not female, Akr1d1-/- mice were more insulin tolerant and had reduced lipid accumulation in the liver and adipose tissue yet had hypertriglyceridemia and increased intramuscular triacylglycerol. This phenotype was associated with sexually dimorphic changes in bile acid metabolism and composition but without overt effects on circulating glucocorticoid levels or glucocorticoid-regulated gene expression in the liver. Male Akr1d1-/- mice were not protected against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In conclusion, this study shows that AKR1D1 controls bile acid homeostasis in vivo and that altering its activity can affect insulin tolerance and lipid homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner.;"Arvaniti, Anastasia; Bentley, Liz; Cox, Roger D; Cummins, Carolyn L; Dempster, Niall; Gathercole, Laura L; Harris, Shelley E; Hazlehurst, Jonathan M; Kratschmar, Denise V; Moolla, Ahmad; Nikolaou, Nikolaos; Odermatt, Alex; Ohlsson, Claes; Penning, Trevor M; Pink, Ryan C; Poolman, Toryn M; Poutanen, Matti; Saikali, Michael F; Todorčević, Marijana; Tomlinson, Jeremy W";10.5281/zenodo.6393887;2022-05-13T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6393887;zenodo;Data_Figure1(A-D)_AKR1D1 knockout mice develop a sex dependent metabolic phenotype;EF2D3844-758A-4F81-A1BD-5A6DD835291E;179400

A fruitful approach to investigate social learning in animals is based on paradigms involving the manipulation of artefacts. However, tool use and elaborate object manipulations are rare in natural conditions, suggesting that social learning evolved in other contexts where fitness consequences are higher, such as discriminating palatable from noxious foods, recognising predators or understanding social hierarchies. We focussed on one such context by investigating whether bonobos socially learned others’ arbitrary food preferences through mere observation. To this end, we trained two demonstrators to prefer or avoid distinctly coloured food items, treated with either a sweet or bitter agent. Demonstrators then displayed their newly acquired preferences in front of naïve subjects. In subsequent choice tests, subjects generally matched their choices to the demonstrators’ preferred food colours, despite having already tasted the equally palatable colour alternative. Both age and exposure to demonstrator preference had a significant positive effect on the proportion of matched choices. Moreover, in a context where errors can be costly, social learning was instant insofar as six of seven subjects used socially learned information to influence their very first food choice. We discuss these findings in light of the current debate on the evolution of social learning in animals.;"Genty, Emilie; Guéry, Jean-Pascal; Shorland, Gladez; Zuberbuhler, Klaus";https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.103912;;https://mendeley.figshare.com/articles/Social_learning_of_arbitrary_food_preferences_in_bonobos/9119837/1;figshare;Social learning of arbitrary food preferences in bonobos;06E36B2A-1831-4BD4-AEFD-1BCBFC495D60;166458
Screams are acoustically distinct, high-pitched and high-amplitude calls, produced by many social species. Despite a wide range of production contexts, screams are characterised by an acoustic structure that appears to serve in altering the behaviour of targeted receivers during agonistic encounters. In chimpanzees, this can be achieved by callers producing acoustic variants that correlate with their identity, social role, relationship with the targeted recipient, the composition of the audience and the nature of the event. Although vervet monkeys (<em>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</em>) have been studied for decades, not much is known about their agonistic screams. Here, we examined agonistic screams produced by wild vervet monkeys to investigate the degree to which caller identity, social role and conflict severity affected call structure. We found that screams were both individually distinctive and dependent of the agonistic events. In particular, victim screams were longer and higher-pitched than aggressor screams, while screams produced in severe conflicts (chases, physical contact) had higher entropy than those in mild conflicts. We discuss these findings in terms of their evolutionary significance and suggest that acoustic variation might serve to reduce the aggression level of opponents, while simultaneously attracting potential helpers.;"Bono, Axelle E.

The authors would highly appreciate to be contacted if the data is used for any purpose.We measured mixing ratios of CO, CO2 and CH4 with a PICARRO G2401 Gas Analyzer. Ozone (O3) mixing ratios were measured with a 2B Technology ozone monitor, model 205. We report five-minute averaged data cleaned from exhaust gas influence. Temporal coverage is from December 20, 2016 to April 10, 2017.The trace gas concentrations represent a large number of atmospheric processes that happen on different time scales. CO for example, has basically no sources other than combustion and can hence be used as tracer for air mass transport from regions with combustion activities (e.g., South Africa). CO has a lifetime of a few weeks. CO2 and CH4 are longer-lived trace gases which disperse globally. The data set shows that concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere are higher than in the Southern Hemisphere. Both trace gases are emitted by anthropogenic activities as well as natural sources. Over the cruise track, areas of the Southern Ocean were passed where these trace gases either outgas or are absorbed. Ozone is a secondary trace gas, meaning that it is formed in the atmosphere. It’s concentrations are relatively low.All trace gases data have been cleaned from exhaust gas influence.;"Baccarini, Andrea; Gysel-Beer, Martin; Hartmann, Markus; Henning, Silvia; Lehtipalo, Katrianne; Schmale, Julia; Tatzelt, Christian; Tummon, Fiona; Welti, André";10.5281/zenodo.2636779;2019-06-19T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/2636779#.XvWZH9XKFhE;Zenodo;Trace gas mixing ratios measured over the Southern Ocean in the austral summer of 2016/2017, during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition.;6AC7027C-9D78-4250-A536-A4A24B4444B6;169090

Some animals have basic culture, but to date there is not much evidence that cultural traits evolve as part of a cumulative process as seen in humans. This may be due to limits in animal physical cognition, such as an inability to compare the efficiency of a novel behavioural innovation with an already existing tradition. We investigated this possibility with a study on a natural tool innovation in wild chimpanzees: moss-sponging, which recently emerged in some individuals to extract mineral-rich liquids at a natural clay-pit. The behaviour probably arose as a variant of leaf-sponging, a tool technique seen in all studied chimpanzee communities. We found that moss-sponges not only absorbed more liquid but were manufactured and used more rapidly than leaf-sponges, suggesting a functional improvement. To investigate whether chimpanzees understood the advantage of moss- over leaf-sponges, we experimentally offered small amounts of rainwater in an artificial cavity of a portable log, together with both sponge materials, moss and leaves. We found that established moss-spongers (having used both leaves and moss to make sponges) preferred moss to prepare a sponge to access the rainwater, whereas leaf-spongers (never observed using moss) preferred leaves. Survey data finally demonstrated that moss was common in forest areas near clay-pits but nearly absent in other forest areas, suggesting that natural moss-sponging was at least partly constrained by ecology. Together, these results suggest that chimpanzees perceive functional improvements in tool quality, a crucial prerequisite for cumulative culture.;"Gier, Jennifer; Gruber, Thibaud; Lamon, Noemie; Neumann, Christof; Zuberbühler, Klaus";https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.1715;;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/suppl/10.1098/rspb.2018.1715;supplementary;Wild chimpanzees select tool material based on efficiency and knowledge;71832EB3-B390-4E9E-92B3-5BC0855717CF;166458

Chitin soil amendment is known to improve soil quality, plant growth and plant stress resilience, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we monitored chitin’s effect on lettuce physiology every two weeks through an eight-week growth period, analyzed the early transcriptional reprogramming and related metabolomic changes of lettuce, in response to crab chitin treatment in peat-based potting soil. In commercial growth conditions, chitin amendment still promoted lettuce growth, increased chlorophyll content, the number of leaves and crop head weight from week six. The flavonoid content in lettuce leaves was altered as well, showing an increase at week two but a decrease from week six. Transcriptomic analysis showed that over 300 genes in lettuce root were significant differentially expressed after chitin soil treatment. Gene Ontology-term (GO) enrichment analysis revealed statistical overrepresentation of GO terms linked to photosynthesis, pigment metabolic process and phenylpropanoid metabolic process. Further analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the flavonoid pathway is mostly upregulated whereas the bifurcation of upstream phenylpropanoid pathway towards lignin biosynthesis is mostly downregulated. Metabolomic analysis revealed the upregulation of salicylic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid in chitin treated lettuce seedlings. These phenolic compounds mainly influence the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and may play important roles in plant defense reactions. Our results suggest that chitin soil amendments might activate induced resistance by priming lettuce plants and promote lettuce growth via transcriptional changes.;"Cottyn, Bart; De Keyser, Ellen; Kaufmann, Moritz; Li, Leilei; Mackechemu, Moffat; Pothier, Joël F.; Uyttendaele, Mieke; Van Poucke, Christof; Zipfel, Cyril";GSE224725;2023-03-28T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE224725;NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);Assessment of transcriptional reprogramming of lettuce roots in response to chitin soil amendment;3ECC1DAF-4579-4FB4-B04C-D205CA6366B5;189340

In Virtual Reality, having a virtual body opens a wide range of possibilities as the participant’s avatar can appear to be quite different from oneself for the sake of the targeted application (e.g., for perspective-taking). In addition, the system can partially manipulate the displayed avatar movement through some distortion to make the overall experience more enjoyable and effective (e.g., training, exercising, rehabilitation). Despite its potential, an excessive distortion may become noticeable and break the feeling of being embodied into the avatar. Past researches have shown that individuals have a relatively high tolerance to movement distortions and a great variability of individual sensitivities to distortions. In this article, we propose a method taking advantage of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to efficiently identify the magnitude of the maximum distortion that does not get noticed by an individual (further noted the detection threshold). We show through a controlled experiment with subjects that the RL method finds a more robust detection threshold compared to the adaptive staircase method, i.e., it is more able to prevent subjects from detecting the distortion when its amplitude is equal or below the threshold. Finally, the associated majority voting system makes the RL method able to handle more noise within the forced choices input than adaptive staircase. This last feature is essential for future use with physiological signals as these latter are even more susceptible to noise. It would then allow to calibrate embodiment individually to increase the effectiveness of the proposed interactions;Porssut, Thibault;" 10.5281/zenodo.4298840 ";;https://zenodo.org/record/4298840;Zenodo;Adapting Virtual Embodiment through Reinforcement Learning;B7C6F536-EBA2-4D43-885A-CC4E146400B9;178790
The perception of one’s own body is a complex mechanism that can be disturbed by conflicting sensory information and lead to illusory (mis-) perceptions. Prominent models of multisensory integration propose that sensory streams are integrated according to their reliability by approximating Bayesian inference. As such, when considering self-attribution of seen motor actions, previous works argue in favor of visual dominance over other sensations, and internal cues. In the present work, we use virtual reality and a haptic glove to investigate the influence of an active haptic feedback on one’s visual and agency judgments over a performed finger action under experimentally manipulated visual and haptic feedbacks. Data overall confirm that vision dominates for agency judgment in conditions of multisensory conflict. Interestingly, we also show that participants’ visual judgment over their finger action is sensitive to multisensory conflicts (vision, proprioception, motor afferent signals, and haptic perception), thus bringing an important nuance to the widely accepted view on a general visual dominance;Boban, Loen;10.3389/frvir.2022.860872;2022-04-27T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/7009205;Zenodo;Changing Finger Movement Perception: Influence of Active Haptics on Visual Dominance;309364AC-B880-49D0-94D5-FACA6B2D89DC;178790

Research studying various aspects of technological progress is benefiting from the greater availability of structured data, specifically patent data. A number of databases (EPO's PATSTAT, USPTO's PatentsView, Google Patents, ...) provide well-structured data on patents, which researchers from various fields can use. However, the nature of patent data remains complex, creating a barrier for researchers. This notebook and its companion article seek to demystify patent data.

Thermal adaptation is an extensively used intervention for enhancing or suppressing thermogenic and mitochondrial activity in adipose tissues. As such, it has been suggested as a potential lifestyle intervention for body weight maintenance. While the metabolic consequences of thermal acclimation are not limited to the adipose tissues, the impact on the rest of the tissues in context of their gene expression profile remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the effects in a comparative multi-tissue RNA sequencing approach following exposure of mice to 10 °C, 22 °C, or 34 °C in a panel of organs consisting of spleen, bone marrow, spinal cord, brain, hypothalamus, ileum, liver, quadriceps, subcutaneous-, visceral- and brown adipose tissues. We highlight that transcriptional responses to temperature alterations exhibit a high degree of tissue-specificity both at the gene level and at GO enrichment gene sets, and show that the tissue-specificity is not directed by the distinct basic gene expression pattern exhibited by the various organs. Our study places the adaptation of individual tissues to different temperatures in a whole-organism framework and provides integrative transcriptional analysis necessary for understanding the temperature-mediated biological programming.;"Chevalier, Claire; Çolakoğlu, Melis; Hadadi, Noushin; Merkler, Doron; Salinas, Gabriela; Spiljar, Martina; Steinbach, Karin; Trajkovski, Mirko";10.7554/eLife.78556;2022-05-17T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE198046;"NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus ";Comparative multi-tissue profiling reveals extensive tissue-specificity in transcriptome reprogramming during thermal adaptation;74F39D62-291A-425A-9B04-453978914F29;173010

To reach the surface, dykes must overcome the inherent tensile strength of the country rock. As they do, they generate swarms of seismic signals, frequently used for forecasting. In this study we pressurize and inject molten acrylic into an encapsulating host rocks of (1) Etna basalt and (2) Comiso limestone, at 30 MPa of confining pressure. Fracture was achieved at 12 MPa for Etna basalt and 7.2 MPa for Comiso limestone. The generation of radial fractures was accompanied by acoustic emissions (AE) at a dominant frequency of 600 kHz. During “magma” movement in the dykes, AE events of approximately 150 kHz dominant frequency were recorded. We interpret our data using AE location and dominant frequency analysis, concluding that the seismicity associated with magma transport in dykes peaks during initial dyke creation but remains significant as long as magma movement continues. These results have important implications for seismic monitoring of active volcanoes.;"Bakker, Richard R.; Benson, Philip M.; Dingwell, Donald B.; Fazio, Marco; Hess, Kai-Uwe";0094-8276;2016-03-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/114033?show=full;research-collection.ethz;The propagation and seismicity of dyke injection, new experimental evidenceDYKE INJECTION ACOUSTIC EMISSION;A740672F-EDB3-41D7-AEFF-9D5BA64FC61F;137867

Allergic diseases represent a global health and economic burden of increasing significance. The lack of disease-modifying therapies besides specific allergen immunotherapy (AIT) which is not available for all types of allergies, necessitates the study of novel therapeutic approaches. Exosomes are small endosome-derived vesicles delivering cargo between cells and thus allowing inter-cellular communication. Since immune cells make use of exosomes to boost, deviate, or suppress immune responses, exosomes are intriguing candidates for immunotherapy. Here, we review the role of exosomes in allergic sensitization and inflammation, and we discuss the mechanisms by which exosomes could potentially be used in immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of allergic diseases. We propose the following approaches: (a) Mast cell-derived exosomes expressing IgE receptor FcεRI could absorb IgE and down-regulate systemic IgE levels. (b) Tolerogenic exosomes could suppress allergic immune responses via induction of regulatory T cells. (c) Exosomes could promote TH1-like responses towards an allergen. (d) Exosomes could modulate IgE-facilitated antigen presentation.;"Engeroff, Paul; Vogel, Monique";10.3390/vaccines10010133;2022-01-17T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780385/;Pub med;The Potential of Exosomes in Allergy Immunotherapy;F7D764A6-4FDE-4D72-ACD8-000015504990;179165

1) ImageJ Plugin: Gaussian Filter 5DA simple 5D Gaussian filter plugin for signal processing. This was currently missing from the default ImageJ tools, since the built-in 3D filter functionality does not fully support filtering higher-order stacks (such as combined z+t). The current plugin is natively capable of processing a 5-D stack, and is able to filter in all dimensions (except across channels). A DC offset option is provided to blank arbitrary noise values below a selectable threshold.2) ImageJ Plugin: MultiROI TZ ProfilerA multi-ROI trace plotter allowing for interactive, real-time exploration of the 5D data by the user. This expands the functionality of the built-in “Z-axis profiler” tool set up by the NIH developers (Baler and Rasband, 2003) which allows for plotting the average ROI signal through space or time. Using the Z-axis profiler code as a starting base, we added the multi-ROI (multi-trace) capability, as well as the capability of adding an externally loaded trace (e.g., an electrophysiology trace) to the plot. A number of other user-friendly options such as filtered trace overlay, color-coding and various display normalization options, are also provided via an extra interface window. The plugin implements dynamic update capability, allowing the user to move and modify ROIs, change channels and focal planes, and see the resulting trace changes in real time.3) ImageJ Plugin: Cross-Correlation CalculatorA cross-correlation plugin that performs a comprehensive list of voxel-by-voxel calculations through time in search of temporal correlation versus either an externally loaded trace, a binarized stimulus waveform, or an individual ROI extract. This allows for the easy identification of putatively time-locked regions within a 3D imaging volume. To improve the performance under the jittering response conditions, cumulative cross-correlation (area under the curve) is available in addition to the normal peak calculation. In our studies, we have applied this plugin to axonal stimulation paradigms (minimal stimulations) in the dentate gyrus and have thereby identified several regions within an astrocyte that reliably responded to the stimuli. Such regions corresponded to a fraction of <1% of the total analyzed astrocytic volume (Bindocci et al., 2017).;"Savtchouk, Iaroslav; Volterra, Andrea";DOI;2019-01-29T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/volterralab;Github;Three free plugins that expand the built-in hyperstack analysis functionality of the freely available ImageJ program;0DBA3C87-9C5C-49B0-9AB2-08728EE077B4;173124
AbstractThe majority of cells with latent human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection are located in lymphoid tissues that are difficult to access. In the current study, we used single-genome near-full-length proviral sequencing to evaluate intact and defective proviruses in blood and lymph node CD4 T cells enriched for specific functional polarizations. We observed minor variations between the frequencies of proviral sequences within individual CD4 T-cell subsets and across tissue compartments. However, we noted multiple clonal clusters of identical intact or defective proviral sequences from distinct compartments and CD4 T-cell subpopulations, suggesting frequent interchanges between viral reservoir cells in blood and tissues.;"Banga, Riddhima; Blackmer, Jane E; Cavassini, Matthias; Corpataux, Jean-Marc; Gao, Ce; Kuo, Hsiao-Hsuan; Lee, Guinevere Q; Lichterfeld, Mathias; Pantaleo, Giuseppe; Perreau, Matthieu; Yu, Xu G; zur Wiesch, Schulze";10.1093/infdis/jiaa137;2020-08-15T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT154920;genbank MT154920–MT155385;Blood and Lymph Node Dissemination of Clonal Genome-Intact Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 DNA Sequences During Suppressive Antiretroviral Therapy;8D9D9B2C-818C-4DB4-B79D-0847243DAC4A;173071

"Among ice core drilling sites in the European Alps, Colle Gnifetti (CG) is the only non-temperate glacier to offer climate records back to at least 1000 years. This unique long-term archive is the result of an exceptionally low net accumulation driven by wind erosion and rapid annual layer thinning. However, the full exploitation of the CG time series has been hampered by considerable dating uncertainties and the seasonal summer bias in snow preservation. Using a new core drilled in 2013 we extend annual layer counting, for the first time at CG, over the last 1000 years and add additional constraints to the resulting age scale from radiocarbon dating. Based on this improved age scale, and using a multi-core approach with a neighboring ice core, we explore the time series of stable water isotopes and the mineral dust proxies Ca2+ and insoluble particles. Also in our latest ice core we face the already known limitation to the quantitative use of the stable isotope variability based on a high and potentially non-stationary isotope/temperature sensitivity at CG. Decadal trends in Ca2+ reveal substantial agreement with instrumental temperature and are explored here as a potential site-specific supplement to the isotope-based temperature reconstruction. The observed coupling between temperature and Ca2+-trends likely results from snow preservation effects and the advection of dust-rich air masses coinciding with warm temperatures.We find that if calibrated against instrumental data, the Ca2+-based temperature reconstruction is in robust agreement with the latest proxy-based summer temperature reconstruction, including a ""Little Ice Age"" cold period as well as a medieval climate anomaly. Part of the medieval climate period around 1100-1200 AD clearly stands out through an increased occurrence of dust events, potentially resulting from a relative increase in meridional flow and/or dry conditions over the Mediterranean.";"Bohleber, P.; Erhardt, T.; Fischer, H., H.; Hoffmann, H.; Mayewski, P.; Spaulding, N.";https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.883521;2018-01-10T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.883521;PANGAEA;Temperature and mineral dust variability recorded of ice core Colle_Gnifetti_KCC;34A7460E-6060-4536-8396-9D83A8687229;172506

Raw sequence reads. Microbiota colonization causes profound B cell stimulation and immunoglobulin induction, yet mammals colonized with many taxa have highly complex individualized immunoglobulin repertoires. To deconstruct how the microbiota shapes the B cell pool and its functional responsiveness we have used a simplified model of defined transient microbial exposures by different taxa in germ-free mice. B cell immunoglobulin repertoire development was followed by deep sequencing and in single cells. Intestinal mucosal exposure generated oligoclonal responses which differed from germ-free controls or from the diverse repertoire generated after intravenous systemic exposure. The IgA repertoire, predominantly to cell-surface antigens, did not expand following dose escalation, whereas increased systemic exposure broadened the IgG repertoire to both microbial cytoplasmic and cell-surface antigens. These microbial exposures induced characteristic immunoglobulin heavy chain B cell repertoires mainly at memory and plasma cell stages. Whereas sequential systemic exposure to different taxa diversified the IgG repertoire and facilitated alternate specific responses, sequential mucosal exposure produced limited overlapping repertoires and attrition of initial IgA binding specificities. This shows a contrast between a flexible response to systemic exposure with the need to avoid fatal sepsis, and a restricted response to mucosal exposure reflecting the generic nature of mucosal microbial mutualism;Li, Hai;625440;2020-04-15T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA625440;NCBI;Distinct mucosal or systemic microbiota exposures shape the functional B cell repertoire;6071FD65-9772-4700-B380-9714918D2C50;179479

"The study uses experimental evolution; it aims at understanding evolutionary adaptation to chronic nutritional stress and the role of microbiota in this process. Six outbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster (SEL1-SEL6) have been maintained on a poor larval diet for >190 generations, six control populations (CTL1-CTL6) were maintained in parallel on standard diet. We performed RNAseq on late 3rd instar larvae from both sets of populations under germ-free condition and when they were experimentally colonized by microbiota.

Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingAcute kidney failure and chronic kidney disease are global health issues steadily rising in incidence and prevalence. Animal models are critically needed to better understand these diseases and develop new therapies. These models are typically restricted to a single genetic background, thus fail to recapitulate the hallmarks of human nephropathies and the diversity of their associated clinical presentations. Here, we used a simple model of folic acid-induced kidney injury in 7 highly diverse mouse strains. We measure plasma and urine parameters, as well as renal histopathology and mRNA expression data at 1-, 2- and 6-weeks after folic acid administration, covering the early response and subsequent recovery from injury. We observe an extensive strain-specific response ranging from complete resistance of the CAST/EiJ to high sensitivity of the C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and PWK/PhJ strains. We show that in these susceptible strains, the severe early kidney injury is accompanied by the induction of mitochondrial stress genes, which is associated with delayed healing and a prolonged inflammatory and adaptive immune responses 6 weeks after the insult, heralding a transition to chronic kidney disease. Our data catalogue the variability in predisposition to acute kidney injury, recovery, and transition to chronic kidney disease in laboratory strains, enabling better selection of mouse strains to study kidney disease.;Morel, Jean-David;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE222570;2023-01-11T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE222570;NCBI - GEO;Mouse genetic background controls the severity of kidney injury;52D7560F-48CF-42C2-833E-442164AD1161;179435

"In contrast to other domestic mammals, the embryo-derived signal(s) leading to maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) are still unknow in the mare. We hypothesize that these signals could be packed into uterine extracellular vesicles (uEVs), acting as multi-signal messengers between the conceptus and the maternal tract and contributing to MRP. To unveil these signals, the RNA and protein cargos of uEVs isolated from uterine lavages collected from pregnant mares (P; day 10, 11, 12 and 13 after ovulation) and cyclic control mares (C; day 10 and 13 after ovulation) were analyzed. Our results showed a fine-tuned regulation of the uEV cargo (RNAs and proteins), by the day of pregnancy, the estrous cycle, and even the size of the embryo. A particular RNA pattern was identified with specific increase on P12 related to immune system and hormonal response. Besides, a set of proteins as well as RNAs was highly enriched in EVs on P12 and P13. Differential abundance of miRNAs was also identified in P13-derived uEVs. Their target genes were linked to down- or upregulated genes in the embryo and the endometrium, exposing their potential origin. Our study identified for the first time specific molecules packed in uEVs, which were previously associated to MRP in the mare, and thus bringing added value to the current knowledge.

While it is well-established that distal hypoxia response elements (HREs) regulate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target genes such as erythropoietin (Epo), an interplay between multiple distal and proximal (promoter) HREs has not been described so far. Hepatic Epo expression is regulated by a HRE located downstream of the EPO gene, but this 3' HRE is dispensable for renal EPO gene expression. We previously identified a 5' HRE and could show that both HREs direct exogenous reporter gene expression. Here, we show that whereas in hepatic cells the 3' but not the 5' HRE is required, in neuronal cells both the 5' and 3' HREs contribute to endogenous Epo induction. Moreover, two novel putative HREs were identified in the EPO promoter. In hepatoma cells HIF interacted mainly with the distal 3' HRE, but in neuronal cells HIF most strongly bound the promoter, to a lesser extent the 3' HRE, and not at all the 5' HRE. Interestingly, mutation of either of the two distal HREs abrogated HIF binding to the 3' and promoter HREs. These results suggest that a canonical functional HRE can recruit multiple, not necessarily HIF, transcription factors to mediate HIF binding to different distant HREs in an organ-specific manner.;Wenger, Roland;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qfttdz0dd;2020-04-29T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.qfttdz0dd;Dryad;Distal and proximal hypoxia response elements cooperate to regulate organ-specific erythropoietin gene expression;2F00E5FA-9692-4B85-99B7-05F405033EA0;184813

Objective:The aim of this work was to explore the feasibility of in vivo and non-invasive monitoring of deuterium/hydrogen (2H/1H) exchange at the metabolic level upon exposure to heavy water (2H2O).Methods:The healthy female mice were randomly assigned to two groups after day 0 when both mice received standard drinking water. The treated mouse was fed with 2H2O (80%, v/v) and the control mouse fed with standard drinking water (H2O) over next 13 days. Real-time mass spectrometric analysis of volatile metabolism emitted through breathing and the skin was performed on days 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, and 13. Animal experiment was approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Jinan University (approval No. 20161117163322) on October 29, 2021.Results:We observed a replacement of 1H by 2H in 52 mass spectral features (60 2H/1H isotopologue pairs) for the mouse fed with 2H2O, but not for the control mouse. These included pyruvic acid and lactic acid, lysine and methyl-lysine as well as short-chain fatty acids comprising acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid.Conclusion:Secondary electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry allows monitoring in vivo 2H-incorporation of metabolites in a non-invasive and real-time setup and opens new opportunities to use 2H tracing to extend current metabolic studies, especially those with a focus on anaerobic glycolysis, lysine methylation and gut microbiome via monitoring of short-chain fatty acids.;"Arnold, Kim; Chen, Xing; Li, Xue; Luan, Tiangang; Singh, Kapil Dev; Sinues, Pablo; Yao, Yao; Yin, Zhihong; Zhang, Hui";10.1097/JBR.0000000000000121;2022-06-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.NaN.com;NaN;In vivo detection of metabolic 2H-incorporation upon ingestion of 2H2O;56D0B05C-93D8-4E99-ABD6-3BF81648EFC8;173168

Cell cycle transitions are generally triggered by variation in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria-causing parasites have a life cycle with unique cell-division cycles, and a repertoire of divergent CDKs and cyclins of poorly understood function and interdependency. We show that Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical regulator of atypical mitosis in the gametogony and is required for mosquito transmission. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs of components in the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. We also provide evidence for indirect regulation of the concomitant M-phase progression. During a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Plasmodium-specific cyclin (SOC2), although we obtained no evidence of SOC2 cycling by transcription, translation or degradation. Our results provide evidence that during Plasmodium male gametogony, this unique cyclin/CDK pair fills the functional space of multiple eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases controlling DNA replication and M-phase progression.;"Botrill , Andrew; Tewari, Rita";PXD017622;;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017622;PRIDE;" divergent cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex controls the atypical replication of Plasmodium berghei during gametogony and parasite transmission.";F4820239-6541-4C90-97A6-FCD759B29F96;179321

"Little is known about how multiple social learning strategies interact and how organismsintegrate both individual and social information. Here we combine, in a wild primate, an opendiffusion experiment with a modeling approach: Network-Based Diffusion Analysis using adynamic observation network. The vervet monkeys we study were not provided with a trainedmodel; instead they had access to eight foraging boxes that could be opened in either of twoways. We report that individuals socially learn the techniques they observe in others. Afterhaving learnt one option, individuals are 31x more likely to subsequently asocially learn theother option than individuals naïve to both options. We discover evidence of a rank transmissionbias favoring learning from higher-ranked individuals, with no evidence for age, sex orkin bias.

A strong coupling of the lattice to functional properties is observed in many transition metal oxide systems such as the ABO3 perovskites. In the quest for tailor-made materials it is essential to be able to control the structural properties of the compound(s) of interest. Here, thin film solid solutions that combine NdNiO3 and LaNiO3, two materials with perovskite structure but distinct space-groups, are analyzed. Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy are combined in a synergistic approach to fully determine the mechanism of the structural crossover with chemical composition. It is found that the symmetry transition is achieved by phase coexistence in a way that depends upon the substrate selected. These results carry implications for analog-tuning of physical properties in future functional materials based on these compounds.;"Alexander, Duncan T.L.; Dominguez, Claribel; Fowlie, Jennifer; Gibert, Marta; Guennou, Mael; Kreisel, Jens; Mundet, Bernat; Schober, Alexander; Toulouse, Constance; Triscone, Jean-Marc";10.26037/yareta:oonzm7k6kfcajgiihcffkxjhci;2021-07-14T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:oonzm7k6kfcajgiihcffkxjhci;Yareta;Crossover between distinct symmetries in solid solutions of rare earth nickelates;8D0B9027-B3F1-4C67-9D8A-1F064D56F8F7;179155
This data set contains optical reflectivity, ellipsometry, optical conductivity, and transport experimental data and Density Function Theory numerical calculations of thin films of LaAlO3 on substrates of YAlO3, NdAlO3, LaAlO3, NdGaO3, and SrTiO3. The data were generated and analyzed during a study of the strain tuning of the optical properties of LaNiO3 films.Abstract: Materials with strong electronic correlations host remarkable -- and technologically relevant -- phenomena such as magnetism, superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions. Harnessing and controlling these effects is a major challenge, on which key advances are being made through lattice and strain engineering in thin films and heterostructures, leveraging the complex interplay between electronic and structural degrees of freedom. Here we show that the electronic structure of LaNiO3 can be tuned by means of lattice engineering. We use different substrates to induce compressive and tensile biaxial epitaxial strain in LaNiO3 thin films. Our measurements reveal systematic changes of the optical spectrum as a function of strain and, notably, an increase of the low-frequency free carrier weight as tensile strain is applied. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that this apparently counter-intuitive effect is due to a change of orientation of the oxygen octahedra.The calculations also reveal drastic changes of the electronic structure under strain, associated with a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition. We provide an online applet to explore these effects. The experimental value of integrated spectral weight below 2 eV is significantly (up to a factor of 3) smaller than the DFT results, indicating a transfer of spectral weight from the infrared to energies above 2 eV. The suppression of the free carrier weight and the transfer of spectral weight to high energies together indicate a correlation-induced band narrowing and free carrier mass enhancement due to electronic correlations. Our findings provide a promising avenue for the tuning and control of quantum materials employing lattice engineering.;"Ardizzone, Ivan; Bachar, Nimrod; Catalano, Sara; Fowlie, Jennifer; Georges, Antoine; Georgescu, Alexandre B.; Gibert, Marta; Kuzmenko, Alexey B.; Peil, Oleg; Strand, Hugo U.

Realization of heterostructures containing multiple two-dimensional electron liquids requires a fine control of the fabrication process. Here, we report a structural and spectroscopy study of LaAlO3/SrTiO3/LaAlO3 trilayers grown on the SrTiO3 substrate by pulsed-laser deposition.  Scanning transmission electron microscopy with the help of ab initio calculations reveals that antisite defects associated with oxygen vacancies are primarily present in the SrTiO3 film (STO-f) close to the p-type interface (STO-f/LaAlO3), while oxygen vacancies prevail close to the top n-type interface (LaAlO3/STO-f). At the same interface, misfit dislocations relax the tensile strain of the top LaAlO3 layer. Combining x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray linear dichroism, resonant photoemission spectroscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy, we observe that the 3d orbital reconstruction at the interface between LaAlO3 and the SrTiO3 substrate is confined over a few interfacial Ti planes while, at the top n-type interface (LaAlO3/STO-f), the absence of a dichroic signal can be related to the blurring of the interfacial orbital reconstruction due to the heterogeneity of defects.;"Caputo, Marco; Gariglio, Stefano; Giulio, Tieri; Gloter, Alexandre; Li, Danfeng; Stéphan, Odile; Strocov, Vladimir N.; Triscone, Jean-Marc";10.26037/yareta:clk5af36yjgkdocrwb4nw5h574;2020-04-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:clk5af36yjgkdocrwb4nw5h574;Yareta;Role of point and line defects on the electronic structure of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces;81F19A7D-02CC-41C1-8BB4-55119C7E2BAE;179155
Controlling phase transitions in transition metal oxides remains a central feature of both technological and fundamental scientific relevance. A well-known example is the metal-insulator transition, which has been shown to be highly controllable. However, the length scale over which these phases can be established is not yet well understood. To gain insight into this issue, we atomically engineered an artificially phase-separated system through fabricating epitaxial superlattices that consist of SmNiO3 and NdNiO3, two materials that undergo a metal-to-insulator transition at different temperatures. We demonstrate that the length scale of the interfacial coupling between metal and insulator phases is determined by balancing the energy cost of the boundary between a metal and an insulator and the bulk phase energies. Notably, we show that the length scale of this effect exceeds that of the physical coupling of structural motifs, which introduces a new framework for interface-engineering properties at temperatures against the bulk energetics.;"Catalano, Sara; Dominguez Ordonez, Claribel; Duncan, Alexander; Fowlie, Jennifer; Georges, Antoine; Georgescu, Alexandre B.; Ghosez, Philippe; Gibert, Marta; Mercy, Alain; Millis, Andrew J.; Mundet, Bernat; Triscone, Jean-Marc; Waelchli, Adrien; Zhang, Yajun";10.26037/yareta:ese7b2ms6vbf3despucbkrlzla;2020-08-10T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:ese7b2ms6vbf3despucbkrlzla;Yareta;Length scales of interfacial coupling between metal and insulator phases in oxides;CB0E5EAC-064D-499F-BBE8-B4D2FFBC425E;179155
SrTiO3 is an insulating material which, using chemical doping, pressure, strain or isotope substitution, can be turned into a ferroelectric material or into a superconductor. The material itself, and the two aforementioned phenomena, have been subjects of intensive research of Karl Alex Müller and have been a source of inspiration, among other things, for his Nobel prize-winning research on high temperature superconductivity. An intriguing outstanding question is whether the occurrence of ferroelectricity and superconductivity in the same material is just a coincidence, or whether a deeper connection exists. In addition there is the empirical question of how these two phenomena interact with each other. Here we show that it is possible to induce superconductivity in a two-dimensional layer at the interface of SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 when we make the SrTiO3 ferroelectric by means of18 O substitution. Our experiments indicate that the ferroelectricity is perfectly compatible with having a superconducting two-dimensional electron system at the interface. This provides a promising avenue for manipulating superconductivity in a non centrosymmetric environment.;"Boselli, Margherita; Gariglio, Stefano; Giannini, Enrico; Pulmannova, Dorota; Rischau, Carl Willem; Scheerer, Gernot; Triscone, Jean-Marc; van der Marel, Dirk; Waelchli, Adrien";10.26037/yareta:5rejm5foaba3nns3wm4sl5gxbu;2020-10-15T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:5rejm5foaba3nns3wm4sl5gxbu;Yareta;Ferroelectricity, Superconductivity, and SrTiO3 - Passions of K.A.

During mitosis, chromatin condensation shapes chromosomes as separate, rigid and compacted sister-chromatids to facilitate their segregation. Here, we show that unlike wild type yeast chromosomes, non-chromosomal DNA circles and chromosomes lacking a centromere fail to condense during mitosis. Genetics and ChIP-seq experiments establish that the centromere functions in chromosome condensation upstream of the kinases Aurora B and Bub1. Downstream of Aurora B and Bub1, Shugoshin and the deacetylase Hst2 facilitated spreading of the condensation signal from the pericentromeric region to the chromosome arms. Targeting Aurora B to DNA circles or centromere-ablated chromosomes, or releasing Shugoshin from PP2A-dependent inhibition bypassed the centromere requirement for condensation and enhanced the mitotic stability of DNA circles. Our data indicate that yeast cells license in a centromere-dependent manner the chromosome-autonomous condensation of their chromatin, excluding non-centromeric DNA from this process and thereby inhibiting their propagation.;Chymkowitch, Pierre;GEO: GSE100643;2018-10-11T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100643;Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);Analysis of histone modification in different experimental conditions;7BEB6A63-BD7B-4984-B64D-D204F0BBEB0F;169925

"The raf kinase inhibitor protein, RKIP, is up-regulated on cadiac biopsy specimens of heart failure patients. To investigate the in vivo role of an increased cardiac content of RKIP, we generated transgenic mice with myocardium-specific expression of RKIP (PEBP1; phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1) under control of the alpha-MHC promoter in B6 (C57BL/6J) background. Because RKIP is a dual-specific GRK2 and Raf kinase inhibitor, RKIP-transgenic mice were compared to transgenic mice with myocardium-specific expression of the GRK2 inhibitor, GRK2-K220R, which is a kinase-inactive GRK2 (ADRBK1) mutant with dominant-negative function. In frame of our studies, we found that RKIP-transgenic mice developed signs of heart failure and cardiotoxic lipid load at an age of 8 months. In contrast, transgenic expression of GRK2-K220R improved cardiac function and protected against chronic pressure overload-induced symptoms of heart failure. To identify genes related to cardiotoxic lipid load, we further determined the cardiac gene expression profile of Tg-SCD1 mice with mypcardium-specific expression of SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1) and Tg-UCP1 mice with heart-specific expression of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1).";"Abd Alla, Joshua; Quitterer, Ursula";GSE120020;2018-09-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120020;NCBI GEO;Whole genome cardiac gene expression profiling of transgenic mice with myocardium-specific expression of RKIP (PEBP1), kinase-inactive GRK2-K220R (ADRBK1_K220R), SCD1, and UCP1;BF5A9D77-B3DA-4774-B21A-77B8DE224A10;169354

Myelin insulates neuronal axons and enables fast signal transmission, constituting a key component of brain development, aging and disease. Yet, myelin-specific imaging of macroscopic samples remains a challenge. Here, we exploit myelin’s nanostructural periodicity, and use small-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography (SAXS-TT) to simultaneously quantify myelin levels, nanostructural integrity and axon orientations in nervous tissue. Proof-of-principle is demonstrated in whole mouse brain, mouse spinal cord and human white and gray matter samples. Outcomes are validated by 2D/3D histology and compared to MRI measurements sensitive to myelin and axon orientations. Specificity to nanostructure is exemplified by concomitantly imaging different myelin types with distinct periodicities. Finally, we illustrate the method’s sensitivity towards myelin-related diseases by quantifying myelin alterations in dysmyelinated mouse brain. This non-destructive, stain-free molecular imaging approach enables quantitative studies of myelination within and across samples during development, aging, disease and treatment, and is applicable to other ordered biomolecules or nanostructures.;"Gao, Zirui; Georgiadis, Marios; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel";https://doi.org/10.16907/0cf7e016-9ac1-4546-8eca-bb59c1a61e34;2021-05-19T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.16907/0cf7e016-9ac1-4546-8eca-bb59c1a61e34;PSI Public Data Repository;Nanostructure-specific X-ray tomography reveals myelin levels, integrity and axon orientations in mouse and human nervous tissue;FF455039-7049-4749-A4B4-CD00FDFF0627;178788

"(1) Background: Transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM4) ion channel aberrant expression or malfunction contributes to different types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, TRPM4 still needs to be validated as a potential target in anti-cancer therapy. Currently, the lack of potent and selective TRPM4 inhibitors limits further studies on TRPM4 in cancer disease models. In this study, we validated novel TRPM4 inhibitors, CBA, NBA, and LBA, in CRC cells. (2) Methods: The potency to inhibit TRPM4 conductivity in CRC cells was assessed with the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Furthermore, the impact of TRPM4 inhibitors on cellular functions, such as viability, proliferation, and cell cycle, were assessed in cellular assays. (3) Results: We show that in CRC cells, novel TRPM4 inhibitors irreversibly block TRPM4 currents in a low micromolar range. NBA decreases proliferation and alters the cell cycle in HCT116 cells. Furthermore, NBA reduces the viability of the Colo205 cell line, which highly expresses TRPM4. (4) Conclusions: NBA is a promising new TRPM4 inhibitor candidate, which could be used to study the role of TRPM4 in cancer disease models and other diseases.";"Baur, Roland; Borgström, Anna; Hauert, Barbara; Peinelt, Christine; Stokłosa, Paulina";10.3390/cancers13215400;2021-11-28T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/5710382#.YZZN3LoxmUn;Zenodo;Investigation of Novel Small Molecular TRPM4 Inhibitors in Colorectal Cancer Cells;45374A45-F9BC-436D-B517-11BD0FF08108;173155
Selection enhances mutation toleration Mutations generate variability that is either neutral or subject to natural selection. Robustness is a measure of the ability to withstand deleterious mutational effects. Zheng et al. exposed Escherichia coli populations expressing a yellow fluorescent protein to strong, weak, or no selection for yellow fluorescence for four generations. They then selected these populations to a related function, green fluorescence, for four more generations. The strong selection first for yellow and then green fluorescence resulted in the most green fluorescence and the accumulation of the most mutations. This outcome likely was due to the increased foldability of the protein. Selection thus provides a threshold for mutation accumulation, but robustness maintains a buffer necessary for protein evolution.

Due to their large heat and moisture storage capabilities, the tropics are fundamental in modulating both regional and global climate. Furthermore, their thermal response during past extreme warming periods, such as super interglacials, is not fully resolved. In this regard, we present high-resolution (analytical) foraminiferal geochemical (δ^18^O and Mg/Ca) records for the last 1800 kyr from the shallow (487 m) Inner Sea drift deposits of the Maldives archipelago in the equatorial Indian Ocean. Considering the diagenetic susceptibility of these proxies, in carbonate-rich environments, we assess the integrity of a suite of commonly used planktonic and benthic foraminifera geochemical datasets (Globigerinoides ruber (white), Globigerinita glutinata (with bulla), Pulleniatina obliquiloculata (with cortex) and Cibicides mabahethi) and their use for future paleoceanographic reconstructions.Using a combination of spot Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer, Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer and Scanning Electron Microscope image data, it is evident that authigenic overgrowths are present on both the external and internal test (shell) surfaces, yet the degree down-core as well as the associated bias is shown to be variable across the investigated species and proxies. Given the elevated authigenic overgrowth Mg/Ca (∼12-22 mmol/mol) and δ^18^O values (closer to the benthic isotopic compositions) the whole-test planktonic G. ruber (w) geochemical records are notably impacted beyond ∼627.4 ka (24.7 mcd). Yet, considering the setting (i.e. bottom water location) for overgrowth formation, the benthic foraminifera δ^18^O record is markedly less impacted with only minor diagenetic bias beyond ∼790.0 ka (28.7 mcd). Even though only the top of the G. ruber (w) and C. mabahethi records (whole-test data) would be suitable for paleo-reconstructions of absolute values (i.e. sea surface temperature, salinity, seawater δ^18^O), the long-term cycles, while dampened, appear to be preserved. Furthermore, planktonic species with thicker-tests (i.e. P. obliquiloculata (w/c)) might be better suited, in comparison to thinner-test counter-parts (i.e. G. glutinata (w/b), G. ruber (w)), for traditional whole-test geochemical studies in shallow, carbonate-rich environments. A thicker test equates to a smaller overall bias from the authigenic overgrowth. Overall, if the diagenetic impact is constrained, as done in this study, these types of diagenetically altered geochemical records can still significantly contribute to studies relating to past tropical seawater temperatures, latitudinal scale ocean current shifts and South Asian Monsoon dynamics.;"Rüggeberg , Andres; Spezzaferri, Silvia; Stainbank, Stephanie";https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.914883;2020-09-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.914883;Pangea;geochemical data, Excel files;8FE88D9D-E9BD-4C5A-A6D1-7D1855A3BFCC;165852

Bath toys pose an interesting link between flexible plastic materials, potable water, external microbial and nutrient contamination, and potentially vulnerable end-users. Here, we characterized biofilm communities inside 19 bath toys used under real conditions. In addition, some determinants for biofilm formation were assessed, using six identical bath toys under controlled conditions with either clean water prior to bathing or dirty water after bathing. All examined bath toys revealed notable biofilms on their inner surface, with average total bacterial numbers of 5.5 x 106 cells/cm2 (clean water controls), 9.5 x 106 cells/cm2 (real bath toys), and 7.3 x 107 cells/cm2 (dirty water controls). Bacterial community compositions were diverse, showing many rare taxa in real bath toys and rather distinct communities in control bath toys, with a noticeable difference between clean and dirty water control biofilms. Fungi were identified in 58 % of all real bath toys and in all dirty water control toys. Based on the comparison of clean water and dirty water control bath toys, we argue that bath toy biofilms are influenced by (1) the organic carbon leaching from the flexible plastic material, (2) the chemical and biological tap water quality, (3) additional nutrients by care products and human body fluids in the bath water, as well as, (4) additional bacteria from dirt and/or the end-users’ microbiome. The present study gives a detailed characterization of bath toy biofilms and a better understanding of determinants for biofilm formation and development in systems comprising plastic materials in contact with potable water.;Lisa, Neu;PRJEB24750;;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena;European Nucleotide Archive;Ugly ducklings - The dark side of plastic materials in contact with potable water;599B6C62-6BD8-4133-9942-CA382E600CF5;163366

Treatment modalities for patients with low grade glioma (LGG) WHO grade II are controversial. Overall survival ranges from 2 to over 15 years depending on molecular and clinical factors. Hence, risk adjusted treatments are required to preserve cognitive function and quality of life. We aim at identifying mechanisms and associated molecular markers predicting benefit from radiotherapy (RT) or temozolomide (TMZ) on progression free survival in 120 isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDHmt) mutant LGG treated in the randomized phase III trial EORTC 22033. IDH mutations, the characteristic hallmark of LGG, are associated with a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Given the genotoxic treatments in this study we determined the DNA methylome of DNA damage response (DDR) genes and assessed the association with progression free survival (PFS). We identified 62 functional CpGs corresponding to 24 of 410 DDR genes in the multidimensional LGG dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Despite the low-powered study, the simulations suggested that seven CpGs, associated with 4 genes could be predictive for PFS in EORTC 22033. Most interestingly, two of the CpGs correspond to MGMT and consisted of the 2 probes used in the MGMT-STP27 classifier. The extent of methylation was predictive for PFS in the TMZ, but not the RT arm. LGG IDHmt and 1p and 19q codeleted that overlap largely with oligodendroglioma displayed a higher extent of MGMT methylation than the IDHmt non-codeleted tumors based on several independent LGG datasets. This is consistent with a better PFS of codeleted patients in the TMZ arm as compared to the non-codeleted patients, while no difference was observed in the RT-arm.;Bady, Pierre;GSE104293;2018-01-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/?term=GSE104293[Accession];NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);The methylome of DDR genes and benefit from RT or TMZ in IDH mutant low grade glioma treated in EORTC 22033;607F1CA1-EE12-4A14-A4CA-D178BC90A986;163297

AbstractDuring the period of maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) in the mare, the embryo needs to signal its presence to the endometrium to prevent regression of the corpus luteum and prepare for establishment of pregnancy. This is achieved by mechanical stimuli and release of various signaling molecules by the equine embryo while migrating through the uterus. We hypothesized that embryo’s signals induce changes in the endometrial gene expression in a highly cell type-specific manner. A spatiotemporal transcriptomics approach was applied combining laser capture microdissection and low-input-RNA sequencing of luminal and glandular epithelium (LE, GE), and stroma of biopsy samples collected from days 10-13 of pregnancy and the estrous cycle. Two comparisons were performed, samples derived from pregnancies with conceptuses ≥ 8 mm in diameter (comparison 1) and conceptuses ≤ 8 mm (comparison 2) versus samples from cyclic controls. The majority of gene expression changes was identified in LE and much lower numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GE and stroma. While 1253 DEGs were found for LE in comparison 1, only 248 were found in comparison 2. Data mining mainly focused on DEGs in LE and revealed regulation of genes related to prostaglandin transport, metabolism, and signaling, as well as transcription factor families that could be involved in MRP. In comparison to other mammalian species, differences in regulation of genes involved in epithelial barrier formation and conceptus attachment and implantation reflected the unique features of equine reproduction at the time of MRP at the molecular level.;"Almiñana, Carmen; Bauersachs, Stefan; Bollwein, Heinrich; Canisso, Igor F.; Podico, Giorgia; Rudolf Vegas, Alba";10.1038/s41598-021-01785-3;2021-12-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA748866;NCBI SRA;Spatiotemporal endometrial transcriptome analysis revealed the luminal epithelium as key player during initial maternal recognition of pregnancy in the mare;1ABDCF47-AEF1-4082-BE15-C8F8FA0E9A27;173171

The family of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) consists of highly conserved proteins, which have important functions in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. In mammals there are three HP1 paralogs: HP1(alpha), Hp1(beta), and Hp1(gamma)They are encoded by the Cbx5, Cbx1, and Cbx3 genes, respectively. Hp1 and Hp1 stably interact with Chd4 and Adnp to form the ChAHP complex. In this project, Chd4, Adnp, and the three Cbx genes were endogenously tagged with a FLAG-Avi tag in mouse embryonic stem cells. The tagged proteins were subjected to tandem-affinity purification and analysis by mass spectrometry.;Iesmantavicius, Vytautas;PXD006226;2018-05-22T00:00:00Z;http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006226;ProteomeXchange, PRIDE repository;The HP1 protein interactome of mouse embryonic stem cells;54E042EB-FFCF-49CE-ACB7-FC1ABA3D9FF0;155940

PICE aims at explaining parental strategies, resources and aspirations and how they shape their children’s educational pathways. PICE is an add-on-study of TREE, Transitions from Education to Employment1 2. TREE consists of two cohorts of school-leavers, TREE1 and TREE2. TREE1-respondents left compulsory school in 2000. TREE2-respondents left compulsory school in 2016. PICE is an add-on to TREE2. Together with TREE, PICE represents a mixed-methods project. PICE has seized the extraordinary opportunity to add a sub-sample of respondents who participate in a semi-structured interview to the TREE2-sample. One of the participants’ parents is interviewed as well and some of them are interviewed twice. With this setup, the PICE-data have lots of potential for a diversity of secondary data analyses. Moreover, PICE has interviewed a cohort which entered the labour market or tertiary education at the time of a global pandemic. This makes it a highly interesting population to study in the future. PICE is a collaborative project between the University of Bern and FORS (Swiss Centre for Expertise in the Social Sciences). PICE is running from 2019 to 2022 and has been financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF-Number 184906).;"Gomensoro, Andrés; Heers, Marieke; Hupka-Brunner, Sandra; Kamm, Chantal; Schnell, Jakob";https://doi.org/10.48573/zb5k-5v15;2023-01-19T00:00:00Z;https://www.swissubase.ch/en/catalogue/studies/20043/latest/datasets/2141/2523/overview;SwissUbase;PICE - Parental Investment in Children's Education (1.0.0);4B79A647-7290-4C51-A465-81363C2F5A35;184906

Tested the hypothesis that intrapsychic conflicts between persistence and disengagement from personal goals (action crises) become subjectively more severe when the negative emotion caused by the conflict is not attributed to an alternative cause. In the experiment, an affect misattribution procedure was used to manipulate whether participants attributed negative emotions to their personal goal or an alternative cause. The results were mixed, suggesting that the experimental design and measurement of potential conflict regarding personal goals needs refinement.;Wolf, Benjamin M.;DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/TM9J4;;https://osf.io/yeu58/;Open Science Framework;Misattribution of negative feelings during action crises;4ED4FF0A-42EF-419A-99A5-CBCD458A81AD;159389

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Its clinical and molecular heterogeneities and the lack of in vitro models outline the complexity of PCa in the clinical and research settings. We established an in vitro mouse PCa model based on organoid technology that takes into account the cell of origin and the order of events. Primary PCa with deletion of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN ( PTEN -del) can be modeled through Pten- down-regulation in mouse organoids. We used this system to elucidate the contribution of TIP5 in PCa initiation, a chromatin regulator that is implicated in aggressive PCa. High TIP5 expression correlates with primary PTEN -del PCa and this combination strongly associates with reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival. TIP5 is critical for the initiation of PCa of luminal origin mediated by Pten -loss whereas it is dispensable once Pten -loss mediated transformation is established. Cross-species analyses revealed a PTEN gene signature that identified a group of aggressive primary PCas characterized by PTEN -del, high-TIP5 expression, and a TIP5-regulated gene expression profile. The results highlight the modeling of PCa with organoids as a powerful tool to elucidate the role of genetic alterations found in recent studies in their time orders and cells of origin, thereby providing further optimization for tumor stratification to improve the clinical management of PCa.;"Aprigliano, Rossana; Bär, Dominik; Bolis, Marco; Kuzyakiv, Rostyslav; Pietrzak, Karolina; Santoro, Raffaella; Sauter, Guido; Simon, Ronald; Theurillat, Jean-Philippe";10.1073/pnas.1911673117;2020-02-03T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131845;NCBI GEO;TIP5 primes prostate luminal cells for the oncogenic transformation mediated by PTEN -loss;13B411EC-A642-4CC7-BE2D-D83C49B38E86;173056

We surveyed Swiss politicians from the National Council and the Council of States as well as regional politicians from the Great Councils of Geneva and Berne. An exceptionally high number of 368 Swiss politicians participated in our study (61-88% per parliament). The survey data were complemented by biographical data (such as age, gender, committee membership, number of preferential votes, and so forth) for those MPs who had participated in the study.We also conducted, with FORS as subcontractor, a representative survey among 10'000 Swiss citizens to learn what they think about very specific policy proposals. About 47% of the people we contacted participated in the study.The data collection efforts are extensively documented on the project web site (see https://www.unige.ch/rep/findings) and technical reports describing the data collection and codebook for the MPs and citizens surveys can be downloaded there.

Adult male mice underwent injection in the basal amygdala (BA) with an AAV vector encoding tetanus toxin light chain in a Cre-dependent manner (AAV dlox-TeTxLC), and in the nucleus accumbens with a retrograde Cre AAV vector (AAV retro-Cre-mCherry). Control group mice were injected in BA with AAV dlox-TeTxLC and in NAc with AAV retro-mCherry. After 15 days, brains were collected. Coronal sections inluding the basal amygdala were prepared. Laser capture microdissection was used to identify and collect mCherry+ neuronal cell bodies in the BA (i.e. BA-NAc neurons). 500 such tissue samples were collected per mouse, lysis was conducted, and lysates pooled. RNA was isolated, followed by cDNA synthesis and library preparation. Low-input RNA sequencing was conducted on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina).

DNA-damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2) is an aspartic protease that cleaves and activates the transcription factor NRF1. Cellular models have shown that this pathway contributes to cell-stress adaption, for example, upon proteasome inhibition. However, DDI2 physiological function is unknown. Ddi2 Knock-out (KO) mice are embryonic lethal. However, we found that liver-specific Ddi2-KO animals are viable. We used comprehensive genetic analysis to identify the molecular pathways regulated by DDI2. We show that DDI2 mediates metallothionein (MT) expression in mouse and human hepatocytes in response to cadmium (Cd). Cd exposure inhibits the proteasome activity, resulting in NRF1 accumulation in the cytoplasm, followed by cleavage by DDI2 and translocation to the nucleus to activate MTs. Depleting DDI2 or NRF1 by CRISPR/Cas9 impaired MTs activation and sensitized the cells to Cd or cisplatin toxicity. This study identifies a new function for DDI2 that links proteasome homeostasis to heavy metal mediated toxicity.;Martinon, Fabio;GSE198150;2023-03-02T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE198150;Gene Expression Omnibus;The protease DDI2 regulates NRF1-metallothionein pathway in response to Cadmium toxicity in the liver;3B198E81-BF2B-44B4-B8B7-D5F9010746A0;173152

The metal ion transporter ZIP8 (SLC39A8) mediates cellular uptake of vital divalent metal ions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant A391T (rs13107325) is associated with numerous human traits, including reduced arterial blood pressure, increased body mass index and hyperlipidemia. We analyzed in vitro the transport properties of mutant ZIP8 A391T and investigated in vivo in mice the physiological effects of this polymorphism. In vitro , the intrinsic transport properties of mutant ZIP8 were similar to those of wild type ZIP8, but cellular uptake of zinc, cadmium and iron was attenuated due to reduced ZIP8 plasma membrane expression. We then generated the ZIP8 A393T mice (ZIP8KI) that carry the corresponding polymorphism and characterized their phenotype. We observed lower protein expression in lung and kidney membrane extracts in ZIP8KI mice. The ZIP8KI mice exhibited striking changes in metal ion composition of the tissues, including cobalt, palladium, mercury and platinum. In agreement with GWAS, ZIP8KI mice showed reduced arterial blood pressure. Body weight and plasma lipid composition remained unchanged, although these features were reported to be increased in GWAS. ZIP8KI mice also exhibited remarkable insulin resistance and were protected from elevated blood glucose when challenged by dietary sucrose supplementation. We showed that increased hepatic insulin receptor expression and decreased ZnT8 (slc30a8) metal ion transporter mRNA expression are associated with this phenotypic change. In conclusion, our data reveal that ZIP8 plays an important role in blood pressure regulation and glucose homeostasis.;"Bermudez-Lekerika, Paola; Bhardwaj, Rajesh; Escher, Geneviève; Fuster, Daniel G.; Hediger, Matthias A.; Hofstetter, Willy; Lenglet, Sébastien; Pujol-Giménez, Jonai; Scherler, Laeticia; Siegrist, Mark; Thomas, Aurélien; Verouti, Sophia N.; Vogt, Bruno";doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2022.912277;2022-06-15T00:00:00Z;https://figshare.com/s/628179df229ceb472160;figshare;The Allelic Variant A391T of Metal Ion Transporter ZIP8 (SLC39A8) Leads to Hypotension and Enhanced Insulin Resistance;0F696B33-B9C6-46DA-953A-6DF8ED41E318;182272

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Social animals have evolved a range of signals to avoid aggressive and facilitate affiliative interactions. Vocal behaviour is especially important in this respect with many species, including various primates, producing acoustically distinct ‘greeting calls’ when two individuals approach each other. While the ultimate function of greeting calls has been explored in several species, little effort has been made to understand the mechanisms of this behaviour across species. The aim of this study was to explore how differences in individual features (individual dominance rank), dyadic relationships (dominance distance and social bond strength) and audience composition (presence of high-ranking or strongly bonded individuals in proximity), related to vocal greeting production during approaches between two individuals in the philopatric sex of four primate species: female olive baboons (<i>Papio anubis</i>), male chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), female sooty mangabeys (<i>Cercocebus atys</i>) and female vervet monkeys (<i>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</i>). We found that female vervet monkeys did not produce greeting calls, while in the other three species, low-ranking individuals were more likely to call than high-ranking ones. The effects of dyadic dominance relationships differed in species-specific ways, with calling being positively associated with the rank distance between two individuals in baboons and chimpanzees, but negatively in mangabeys. In none of the tested species did we find strong evidence for an effect of dyadic affiliative relationships or audience on call production. These results likely reflect deeper evolutionary layers of species-specific peculiarities in social style. We conclude that a comparative approach to investigate vocal behaviour has the potential to not only better understand the mechanisms mediating social signal production but also to shed light on their evolutionary trajectories.;"Bouquet, Yaelle; Fedurek, Pawel; Magris, Martina; Mercier, Stephanie; Neumann, Christof; Quintero, Fredy; Zuberbuhler, Klaus";https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.182181;;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/suppl/10.1098/rsos.182181;supplementary;Behavioural patterns of vocal greeting production in four primate species;8ECBED13-C131-4A4A-8D9F-DE834C62BBA3;166458

Malaria parasites go through major transitions during their complex life cycle, yet the underlying differentiation pathways remain obscure. Here we apply single cell transcriptomics to unravel events that initiate sexual development in preparation for transmission of the parasite from human to mosquito. This proof-of-concept study provides a template to capture transcriptional diversity in heterogeneous parasite populations, with major implications for our understanding of parasite biology and the ongoing malaria elimination campaign.;"Birren, Bruce W.; Brancucci, Nicolas M.B.; De Niz, Mariana; Marti, Matthias; Neafsey, Daniel E.; Ravel, Deepali; Sollelis, Lauriane; Straub, Timothy J.; Voss, Till S.";DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/QMXVZ;2018-10-17T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE96066;GEO;Probing Plasmodium falciparum sexual commitment at the single-cell level;1425A353-815F-4891-9CEB-4C89583CD95E;163258

Bacteria swim and swarm by rotating the micrometers long, helical filaments of their flagella. They change direction by reversing their flagellar rotation, which switches the handedness of the filament's supercoil. So far, all studied functional filaments are composed of a mixture of L- and R-state flagellin monomers. Here we show in a study of the wild type Firmicute Kurthia sp., that curved, functional filaments can adopt a conformation in vivo that is closely related to a uniform, all-L-state. This sheds additional light on transitions of the flagellar supercoil and uniquely reveals the atomic structure of a wild-type flagellar filament in vivo, including six residues showing clearly densities of O-linked glycosylation.;"Abrahams, Jan Pieter; Blum, Thorsten";10.2210/pdb6T17/pdb;2019-10-30T00:00:00Z;http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6T17;6T17.pdb;Cryo-EM structure of the wild-type flagellar filament of the Firmicute Kurthia;BFA17562-2424-4DF1-968A-B9C794B686D7;165669

We image using phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy propagating spin waves in a one-dimensional magnonic crystal consisting of dipolarly coupled magnetic nanostripes. We demonstrate phase shifts upon a single nanostripe of opposed magnetization. Using micromagnetic simulations, we model our experimental finding in a wide parameter space of bias fields and wave vectors. We find that low-loss phase inversion is achieved, when the internal field of the oppositely magnetized nanostripe is tuned such that the latter supports a resonant standing spin wave mode with an odd quantization number at the given frequency. Our results are key for the realization of phase inverters with optimized signal transmission.;"Baumgaertl, Korbinian; Grundler, Dirk";https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4680409;;https://zenodo.org/record/4680409#.YHgQRT_RY2w;Zenodo;Bistable nanomagnet as programable phase inverter for spin waves;50A9F201-85BE-4758-8380-D18E4BF04AE2;163016
Many animal species produce ritualized signals during dyadic encounters but the functions of such‘greeting’ behaviour vary considerably, or are often unknown. One established function is to acknowledgeexisting dominance relationships. At the same time, call rates often increase during social tension,suggesting additional functions, such as to appease higher-ranking individuals, or to maintain spatialproximity and friendly relations. For vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, vocal behaviour has beenstudied extensively, but little research has been devoted to calls given during encounters between twoindividuals, i.e. grunts. Here, we examined how individual and relationship features affected the vocalgreeting behaviour of wild vervet monkeys in different ecological and social situations. We used aninformation theory approach to investigate the functional hypotheses of vervet monkeys' vocal greetingsignals. We found little support for the main functions proposed in the literature, that is, to signalsubmission, to avoid conflicts, to test social bonds or to coordinate group activity. Results supported theuse of grunts to signal benign intent, and we found that grunts were mostly given to closely bondedmales near rivers, suggesting that vervet monkeys use vocal greeting signals to recruit individuals insituations of danger to reduce predation risk.;"Chollet, Emmeline; Mercier, Stéphanie; Meric de Bellefon, Jade; Neumann, Christof; van de Waal, Erica; Zuberbühler, Klaus";https://figshare.com/s/259509e0b8b29fe81b90;2017-10-01T00:00:00Z;https://figshare.com/s/259509e0b8b29fe81b90;Figshare;Vervet monkeys greet adult males during high-risk situations;A3111AF6-DA12-485D-AB07-73754E4C713E;159587

We describe the construction of an extensive set of global value chain (GVC) participation and network indicators for 141 countries in the years 2004, 2007, 2011, 2014, and 2017. These measures are constructed from one of the most detailed input-output (IO) databases available which covers data on production and trade for 65 sectors in all of the regions and years included in the database. We describe how the raw IO data is extended to a global multi-region input-output (MRIO) table which captures complex transactions between all sectors and regions in the database. From these MRIO tables we derive a detailed database on bilateral trade in value added (TiVA). Both sources, the MRIO tables and the TiVA measures, are the basis for a range of measures for the participation of the regions in our database in arbitrarily complex global value chain activities. Indicators capturing the foreign and domestic content of bilateral gross exports and domestic sales round up the measures on GVC partic- ipation. We complement these data with a set of detailed network indicators for all regions considered. The database accompanying this documentation is the main output of Work Package 1 of the project “Complexity - Complexity and the structure and regulation of trade and investment” funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).;"Desilvestro, Valentino; Francois, Joseph; Tomberger, Patrick";https://dx.doi.org/10.7892/boris.148203;2020-11-06T00:00:00Z;https://boris.unibe.ch/id/eprint/148203;Valentino Desilvestro;Measuring the complexity of global value chains: a database of the network structure of trade;E8A907FF-BD14-406F-875C-ACC736EBDEA5;176384

Despite the importance of surface energy budgets (SEBs) for land-climate interactions in the Arctic, uncertainties in their prediction persist. In-situ observational data of SEB components - useful for research and model validation - are collected at relatively few sites across the terrestrial Arctic, and not all available datasets are readily interoperable. Furthermore, the terrestrial Arctic consists of a diversity of vegetation types, which are generally not well represented in land surface schemes of current Earth system models. Therefore, we here provide four datasets comprising:1. Harmonized, standardized and aggregated in situ observations of SEB components at 64 vegetated and glaciated sites north of 60° latitude, in the time period 1994-20212. A description of all study sites and associated environmental conditions, including the vegetation types, which correspond to the classification of the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM, Raynolds et al. 2019).3. Data generated in a literature synthesis from 358 study sites on vegetation or glacier (>=60°N latitude) covered by 148 publications.4.

Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that proliferate through iterative cycles of intra-erythrocytic replication. During each cycle a small number of parasites differentiate into gametocytes, the only forms able to infect the mosquito vector and transmit malaria. Sexual commitment is triggered by activation of AP2-G, the master transcriptional regulator of gametocytogenesis. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-dependent silencing of ap2-g prevents sexual conversion and secures proliferation. Here, we identify gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) as the first upstream activator of the sexual differentiation pathway in P. falciparum. Induction of GDV1 expression is sufficient to activate AP2-G expression and sexual differentiation. We found that GDV1 targets heterochromatin and triggers HP1 eviction preferentially at ap2-g and other gametocyte-specific genes. We further demonstrate that GDV1-dependent activation of ap2-g is controlled via a gdv1 antisense RNA. In summary, we identify GDV1 as an unprecedented cell fate decision factor that induces sexual differentiation by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing.;"Bártfai, Richárd; Brancucci, Nicolas M.

Snow depth has traditionally been estimated based on point measurements collected either manually or at automated weather stations. Point measurements, though, do not represent the high spatial variability of snow depths present in alpine terrain. Photogrammetric mapping techniques have progressed in recent years and are capable of accurately mapping snow depth in a spatially continuous manner, over larger areas, and at various spatial resolutions. However, the strengths and weaknesses associated with specific platforms and photogrammetric techniques, as well as the accuracy of the photogrammetric performance on snow surfaces have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, industry-standard photogrammetric platforms, including high-resolution satellites (Pléiades), airplane (Ultracam Eagle M3), Unmanned Aerial System (eBee+ with S.O.D.A. camera) and terrestrial (single lens reflex camera, Canon EOS 750D), were tested for snow depth mapping in the alpine Dischma valley (Switzerland) in spring 2018. Imagery was acquired with airborne and space-borne platforms over the entire valley, while Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and terrestrial photogrammetric imagery was acquired over a subset of the valley. For independent validation of the photogrammetric products, snow depth was measured by probing, as well as using remote observations of fixed snow poles.When comparing snow depth maps with manual and snow pole measurements the root mean square error (RMSE) values and the normalized median deviation (NMAD) values were 0.52 m and 0.47 m respectively for the satellite snow depth map, 0.17 m and 0.17 m for the airplane snow depth map, 0.16 m and 0.11 m for the UAS snow depth map. The area covered by the terrestrial snow depth map only intersected with 4 manual measurements and did not generate statistically relevant measurements. When using the UAS snow depth map as a reference surface, the RMSE and NMAD values were 0.44 m and 0.38 m for the satellite snow depth map, 0.12 m and 0.11 m for the airplane snow depth map, 0.21 and 0.19 m for the terrestrial snow depth map. When compared to the airplane dataset over a large part of the Dischma valley (40 km2), the snow depth map from the satellite yielded a RMSE value of 0.92 m and a NMAD value of 0.65 m. This study provides comparative measurements between photogrammetric platforms to evaluate their specific advantages and disadvantages for operational, spatially continuous snow depth mapping in alpine terrain over both small and large geographic areas.;"Bühler, Yves; Eberhard, Lucie; Marty, Mauro; Sirguey, Pascal";10.16904/envidat.189;2020-11-11T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/intercomparison-of-photogrammetric-platforms;ENVIDAT;Photogrammetric snow depth maps from satellite-, airplane-, UAS and terrestrial platforms from the Davos region (Switzerland);CE4C4A18-26C8-4949-A47C-DAF3911A2FCC;172800

The increasing density and entanglement of international law and institutions leads to a growing potential for collisions between norms and rules emanating from different international institutions. It is an open question, however, when actors actually create manifest conflicts about overlapping norms and rules and how - and with what consequences - such conflicts are handled. We therefore utilize the concept of “interface conflicts” (ICs) in which two or more actors express positional differences over the scope or prevalence of different international norms. Building on the findings of the DFG research group OSAIC, we introduce the Interface Conflicts 1.0 dataset, which assembles information on 78 ICs.

"To analyse the structure of interaction networks between insect herbivores and their food plants, abundance data of both plants and herbivores was combined with a literature-based interaction database. Abundance data was sampled on 150 grassland plots and 139 forest plots, both covering land-use intensity gradients within the respective ecosystem. Data on plant abundance was collected with yearly vegetation records on all plots (subplots in forests and grasslands), two tree inventories in forests and an inventory of tree regeneration in forests and aggregated to represent average plant-species specific cover and biomass. Data on insect abundance was collected with yearly sweep netting records on all grassland plots (twice a year) between 2008 and 2017 and with flight-interception traps on all forest plots in 2008, 2011, 2014 and aggregated to represent total species-specific abundance. Land-use intensity in grasslands was quantified with a compound index based on mowing, fertilization and grazing intensity (LUI index), which was recorded annually between 2006 and 2017. Land-use intensity in forests was quantified with a compound index based on tree species composition, harvest intensity and deadwood origin (ForMI index), which was determined based on two tree inventories (2008-2014; 2015-2018) and two deadwood and stump inventories (2012; 2017-2018). From plant and herbivore abundance and a literature-based interaction data base (BExIS ID 26926), weighted interaction networks were constructed for all plots.

The design of novel cathode materials for Li-ion batteries requires accurate first-principles predictions of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties as well as intercalation voltages in compounds containing transition-metal (TM) elements. For such systems, density-functional theory (DFT) with standard (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals is of limited use as it often fails due to strong self-interaction (delocalization) errors that are especially large for the partially filled d shells of the TMs. Here, we perform the first comparative study of the phospho-olivine cathode materials LixMnPO4, LixFePO4, and mixed-TM LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 (x=0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1) using four electronic structure methods: DFT, DFT+U, DFT+U+V, and HSE06. We show that DFT+U+V outperforms the other three methods, provided that the onsite U and intersite V Hubbard parameters are determined from first-principles and self-consistently with respect to the structural parameters by means of density-functional perturbation theory (linear response). In particular, we demonstrate that DFT+U+V is the only method that correctly predicts the digital change in oxidation states of the TM ions in all compounds for the mixed-valence phases occurring at intermediate Li concentrations, leading to voltages in remarkable agreement with experiments. We thus show that the inclusion of intersite Hubbard interactions is essential for the accurate prediction of thermodynamic quantities when electronic localization occurs while in the presence of inter-atomic orbital hybridization. At variance with the other methods, DFT+U+V alone is capable to describe such localization-hybridization interplay, and thus opens the door for the study of more complex cathode materials as well as for a reliable exploration of the chemical space of compounds for Li-ion batteries.;Timrov, Iurii;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:7h-7q;2022-09-20T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2022.118;Materials Cloud;" Accurate electronic properties and intercalation voltages of olivine-type Li-ion cathode materials from extended Hubbard functionals";127AB720-DFF8-4A58-B30B-A9AEA4B6CE56;179138

The him-5(e1490) genetic background results in an increased frequency of males in the population. We used an anti-FLAG antibody for the IP and semi-synchronous populations of animals in the L3 and L4 larval stages as samples. The purpose of the experiment was to identify LIN41 mRNA targets in the soma. From the three independent replicates, we determined a set of LIN41-bound mRNAs using edgeR and FDR < 0.05 as a cutoff. This set contained only seven mRNAs, the previously known targets lin-29, mab-10, mab-3 and dmd-3 (Aeschimann et al., Mol Cell, 2017), as well as lin-41 and the unannotated genes F18C5.10 and C31H5.5. We conclude that LIN41 likely only binds to a few somatic mRNA targets. Intersecting this experiment with differential gene expression experiments upon dys-regulation of LIN41 (Aeschimann et al., Mol Cell, 2017) and phenotypic analysis of mutant strains, we further conclude that during larval development, LIN41 likely regulates only a four direct targets, namely lin-29, mab-10, mab-3 and dmd-3.

The Quantum Spin Ice (QSI) state, where the two-in-two-out configurations formed by the Ising variables are allowed to tunnel among themselves, is realised in Pr2Hf2O7 based on our last measurements on IN5 (Nature Physics, 14, 711-715 (2018)). The quantum field theory (quantum electrodynamics) that was used to compare with our data, predicts another distinctive feature for this ground state: our energy-integrated quasi-elastic signal from IN5 should be made of dispersive excitations that play the role of emergent photons (Phys. Rev. B, 86, 075154 (2012)). We propose to measure directly these gapless low-energy excitations, whose bandwidth is predicted to be within 0.01 meV according to our estimate of the speed of the emergent photon based on our last IN5 data.;Sibille, Romain;10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-726;2019-01-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.ill.fr/10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-726;Institute Laue–Langevin data portal;Direct measurement of the magnetic photon excitations in the Quantum Spin Ice Pr2Hf2O7;0046BFF1-4746-4919-8810-53DAEBFD4C4A;179150
Pyrochlore oxides based on non-Kramers rare-earth ions, such as Pr3+ and Tb3+, are candidate materials for the formation of the Quantum Spin Ice. However, structural disorder is thought to be determinant in the selection of this exotic magnetic ground state. Slight level of disorder can indeed induce transverse fields on the Ising spin variable and turn a classical spin ice into a quantum spin ice. When disorder and thus transverse fields are stronger, the Ising spin variables become essentially electric quadupolar degrees of freedom, and the system remains paramagnetic. It is thus of paramount importance to establish detailed knowledge on the type and density of disorder in such materials.

The presence of a dipole-octupole ground state doublet explains remarkably well macroscopic measurements and crystal-field analysis. Furthermore, the octupolar nature of the correlations has been observed, taking the shape of a broad hump located at high momentum transfer in neutron diffraction patterns. Unfortunately, the chemistry of Ce2Sn2O7 makes it challenging to grow single crystals to further elucidate the nature of its ground state. However, it is possible for its parent compound, Ce2Hf2O7. Its chemical and physical similarities with Ce2Sn2O7 motivate its investigation as it could withstand undoubtable fingerprints of this Octupolar QSI. We propose to probe Ce2Hf2O7 crystal field levels of as they play a crucial role in determining the system’s ground state wavefunction and to its understanding.;Sibille, Romain;10.5286/ISIS.E.RB2010672;2020-09-14T00:00:00Z;https://data.isis.stfc.ac.uk/doi/INVESTIGATION/111244700/;ISIS Neutron and Muon Source Data Catalogue;Crystal Field Levels in Cerium Hafnate: a New Quantum Spin Liquid;75BFDC1D-79FF-4014-B3EB-2058951A3815;179150
Our recent measurements on the pyrochlore magnet Ce2Sn2O7 demonstrate that a quantum liquid of magnetic octupoles develops below about 1 K in this material. This exotic state is qualitatively new - at least experimentally - and was revealed by experiments using thermal neutrons, in which a liquid-like signal appears at high momentum transfer due to the peculiar form factor of higher-rank multipoles. Our current understanding of this remarkable phase of matter is that spin excitations have a dipolar character and thus should be measurable using cold neutron inelastic spectroscopy. This indeed appears to be the case based on a short test experiment on IN5, which we need to extend by measurements at several temperatures. We propose to measure the excitation spectrum of Ce2Sn2O7 using IN5. We expect these results will complement our existing data and contribute to an important discovery.;Sibille, Romain;10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-770;2020-01-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.ill.fr/10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-770;Institute Laue–Langevin data portal;Spin excitations of a quantum liquid of octupoles;07091677-93DA-4A4A-B5D9-14E0BC6AF464;179150

X-ray linear dichroism and X-ray birefringence microscopy are yet to be fully utilized as instruments in the microstructural characterization of crystalline materials. These datasets are obtained from the first demonstration of analyzer-free X-ray linear dichroism microscopy using spectroscopic hard X-ray ptychography. Analysis of these data enabled a spectroscopic and microstructural characterization of polycrystalline vanadium pentoxide on the nanoscale, outside of diffraction-contrast based methods.

We use resonant soft x-ray diffraction to track the photoinduced dynamics of the antiferromagnetic structure in a NdNiO3 thin film. Femtosecond laser pulses with a photon energy of 0.61 eV, resonant with electron transfer between long-bond and short-bond nickel sites, are used to excite the material and drive an ultrafast insulator-metal transition. Polarization-sensitive soft x-ray diffraction, resonant to the nickel L3 edge, then probes the evolution of the underlying magnetic spiral as a function of time delay with 80 ps time resolution. By modeling the azimuthal dependence of the scattered intensity for different linear x-ray polarizations, we benchmark the changes of the local magnetic moments and the spin alignment. The measured changes are consistent with a reduction of the long-bond site magnetic moments and an alignment of the spins towards a more collinear structure at early time delays.;"Beyerlein, K.

Collective rotations and tilts of oxygen polyhedra play a crucial role in the physical properties of complex oxides such as magnetism and conductivity. Such rotations can be tuned by preparing thin films in which dimensionality, strain, and interface effects come into play. However, little is known of the tilt and rotational distortions in films a few unit cells thick including the question of if coherent tilt patterns survive at all in this ultrathin limit. Here, a series of films of perovskite LaNiO3 is studied and it is shown that the phonon mode related to oxygen octahedral tilts can be followed by Raman spectroscopy down to a film thickness of three pseudocubic perovskite unit cells (∼1.2 nm). To push the limits of resolution to the ultrathin regime, a statistical analysis method is introduced to separate the Raman signals of the film and substrate. Most interestingly, these analyses reveal a pronounced hardening of the tilt vibrational mode in the thinnest films. A comparison between the experimental results, first principles simulations of the atomic structure, and the standing wave model, which accounts for size effects on the phononic properties, reveals that in the ultrathin regime, the Raman spectra are a hybrid entity of both the bulk and surface phononic behavior. These results showcase Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool to probe the behavior of perovskite films down to the ultrathin limit.;"Fowlie, Jennifer; Gibert, Marta; Guennou, Mael; Iniguez, Jorge; Kreisel, Jens; Schober, Alexander; Triscone, Jean-Marc; Weber, Mads C.; Zhao, Honjian";10.26037/yareta:g5dhhgcumnbshbxywnxhu4xyya;2020-06-02T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:g5dhhgcumnbshbxywnxhu4xyya;Yareta;Vibrational properties of LaNiO3 films in the ultrathin regime;209B7AD5-866E-4A2A-9DD4-23F4CDDF9C70;179155

Hydra possesses three distinct stem cell populations that continuously self-renew and prevent aging in Hydra vulgaris. However sexual animals from the H. oligactis cold-sensitive (Ho_CS) strain develop an aging phenotype upon gametogenesis induction, initiated by the loss of interstitial stem cells. Animals stop regenerating, lose their active behaviors and die within three months. This phenotype is not observed in the cold-resistant Ho_CR strain. To dissect the mechanisms of Hydra aging, we compared the self-renewal of epithelial stem cells in these two strains and found it irreversibly reduced in aging Ho_CS while sustained in non-aging Ho_CR. We also identified a deficient autophagy in Ho_CS epithelial cells, with a constitutive deficiency in autophagosome formation as detected with the mCherry-eGFP-LC3A/B autophagy sensor, an inefficient response to starvation as evidenced by the accumulation of the autophagosome cargo protein p62/SQSTM1, and a poorly-inducible autophagy flux upon proteasome inhibition. In the non-aging H. vulgaris animals, the blockade of autophagy by knocking-down WIPI2 suffices to induce aging. This study highlights the essential role of a dynamic autophagy flux to maintain epithelial stem cell renewal and prevent aging.;"Galliot, Brigitte; Tomczyk, Szymon";Hydratlas.unige.ch;2020-01-23T00:00:00Z;https://hydratlas.unige.ch/blast/datasets/SignificanceB_proteinGroups_raw_data.csv;Hydratlas server;Proteomics dataset from aging and non-aging Hydra oligactis - ProteinGroups_raw_data;4D6BEF38-2317-4F4B-9067-AB16ACC16626;169930

Light at night has strong effects on physiology and behavior of mammals. It affects mood in humans, which is exploited as light therapy, and has been shown to reset the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). This resetting is paramount to align physiological and biochemical timing to the environmental light-dark cycle. Here we provide evidence that light at zeitgeber time (ZT) 22 affects mood-related behaviors also in mice by activating the clock gene Period1 (Per1) in the lateral habenula (LHb), a brain region known to modulate mood-related behaviors. We show that complete deletion of Per1 in mice led to depressive-like behavior and loss of the beneficial effects of light on this behavior. In contrast, specific deletion of Per1 in the region of the LHb did not affect mood-related behavior, but suppressed the beneficial effects of light. RNA sequence analysis in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system revealed profound changes of gene expression after a light pulse at ZT22. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), sensory perception of smell and G-protein coupled receptor signaling were affected the most. Interestingly, most of these genes were not affected in Per1 knock-out animals, indicating that induction of Per1 by light serves as a filter for light-mediated gene expression in the brain. Taken together we show that light affects mood-related behavior in mice at least in part via induction of Per1 in the LHb with consequences on mood-related behavior and signaling mechanisms in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system.;"Albrecht, Urs; Ben Fredj, Naila; Brenna, Andrea; Hui, Ka Yi; Mansencal-Strittmatter, Laureen; Olejniczak, Iwona; Ripperger, Jürgen A.; Sandrelli, Federica; Schnell, Anna; Wendrich, Katrin";PRJNA628975;2021-07-08T00:00:00Z;https://github.com/kayihui/effect_of_light_on_brain_regions;SRA database;Light affects behavioral despair involving the clock gene Period 1;611FDEAF-9887-44DD-BBDB-AC5AE0A9BE98;184667

Data Description9 piezometers consisting of fully screened plastic tubes were installed at an averaged depth of 1.5 to 2m in the outwash plain of the Otemma glacier forefield (WGS84 : 45.93434 / 7.41209). They cover four transects perpendicular to the stream from downstream (A) to upstream to (D).Water table elevation and temperature were recorded in each well at a 10 minute interval using SparkFun MS5803-14BA pressure sensors. Sensor resolution is 1 mm and 0.01 °C, sensor accuracy is ± 2 cm and ± 0.8°C. Sensor bias was verified and corrected by bi-monthly manual groundwater stage measurements.

Experiment 1 is a real-time goal-reaching experiment. Tactile myography (TMG) was used to measure the muscles activations during finger and wrist movements. 54 tasks were administrated to 9 intact participants (6 movements used for training at 3 activation levels, repeated 3 times). Half of the participants began with Ridge regression (RR), while the other half began with Gaussian process regression (GPR). For each task, a virtual hand model would perform a movement to either one-third, two-third or full activation. The participant controlled a second hand model and were asked to have it mimic the action of the first one.In experiment 2, the participants were asked to imitate the movement of a hand model. They were presented three times the same sequence of six movements. The data consist in surface electromyography (sEMG) and TMG measurement. They were recorded during the whole cycle of each stimuli in order to obtain the whole range of activation from rest to complete finger and wrist movement.;Jaquier, Noémie;-;2017-08-11T00:00:00Z;https://www.idiap.ch/paper/mdpi/;Combining Electromyography and Tactile Myography to Improve Hand and Wrist Activity Detection in Prostheses;Combining Electromyography and Tactile Myography to Improve Hand and Wrist Activity Detection in Prostheses;577FDFEE-CA05-44DA-83EE-A6DB584E6490;160665
Im Rahmen des Schweizer Gemeindemonitorings werden seit 1988 der Zustand sowie die Entwicklung der Schweizer Gemeinden untersucht. Bei der Gesamterhebung stehen Fragen zur Leistungsfähigkeit, zu Reformen sowie zum politischen System im Vordergrund. Dazu werden die Schweizer Gemeindeschreiberinnen und Gemeindeschreiber sowie die Exekutivmitglieder in periodischen Abständen von rund 6 Jahren befragt. Diese Befragungen werden von der ZHAW in Zusammenarbeit mit dem IDHEAP Lausanne (bzw. Vorgängerinstitutionen) durchgeführt. Da die Befragung bereits zum sechsten Mal durchgeführt wurde, sind sowohl Quer- (einzelne Jahre) als auch Längsschnittanalysen (über die verschiedenen Datensätze hinweg) möglich.;"Amsellem, Ada; Haus, Alexander; Kaiser, Claire; Keuffer, Nicolas; Ladner, Andreas; Machljankin, Jana; Reichmuth, Lukas; Steiner, Reto";10.23662/FORS-DS-1116-1;2019-11-22T00:00:00Z;https://forsbase.unil.ch/dataset/download-consumer/16497/1889/?csrfmiddlewaretoken=UIdPuosOngdkxjV9mJnoiSVa8U7XPrKSwa8p566ZS8FRo46GFAv0KCq68AyIw99D&btn_download_questions=T%C3%A9l%C3%A9charger+les+donn%C3%A9es;FORSbase;Gemeindemonitoring der Schweizer Gemeinden;9E6DDCCB-8F28-4D13-881D-A68A276210D2;162948
"The corpus contains 15 linguistically annotated samples of ""damaskini"" and other Balkan Slavic manuscripts and print editions from the 16th-19th century, together with over 30 thousand tokens. The texts have similar prose narratives and topics, i.e. hagiographies and apocalyptic themes. The majority of the texts are various editions of the ""Life of St. Petka"" by Patriarch Euthymius of Tarnovo. The primary goal of the corpus is to provide data for studies of developments in both spoken and written language in the mentioned area and period, especially the features typical for the Balkan sprachbund, e.g. postponed articles, and the analytic infinitive. The corpus has been manually lemmatized and annotated with MULTEXT-East morphosyntactic descriptions developed specifically for this corpus (http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/html/msd-bg-dam.html) as well as syntactically analyzed with dependency relations following the Universal Dependencies guidelines (up to Level 2 validation).The annotation reflects a wide spectrum of morphosyntactic features of both archaic (Church Slavonic) and innovative (Bulgarian, Macedonian) varieties. The corpus is a vailable both in source TSV and derived CoNLL-U formats. The TSV format includes tokens including accentuation and interpunction, while CoNLL-U uses a diplomatized transcript, more useful for a full-text search.The author would like to thank Olivier Winistörfer for his invaluable help in preparing the corpus.";Šimko, Ivan;http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1368;2020-01-09T00:00:00Z;https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1368;Slovenian language resource repository CLARIN.SI;Annotated Corpus of Pre-Standardized Balkan Slavic Literature;CC8B08CF-F727-460D-9255-ADC24540D090;176378

PreambleThe project explores the extent to which transnational private governance affects the capacity of workers to take collective action in pursuit of improvements in employment conditions in developing countries.Transnational private labour regulation such as corporate codes of conduct and multi-stakeholder standards on labour, environment or human rights claim to respond to the governance deficits that have arisen as a result of the globalization of global production networks. Yet, little consensus exists about the effectiveness of their monitoring and enforcement practices or their ultimate impact.ContextSince the 1990s, the concern has intensified about the responsibility of businesses in global subcontracting chains for exploitation of labour, inequality, and pollution. Many private transnational regulatory initiatives claim to address this concern by incentivizing multinational companies to voluntary sign up to human rights and environmental standards often referring to, for example, the International Labour Organization’s core labour standards. The effectiveness of this approach remains a complex and highly debated issue.Over the last decade, scholars have studied the emergence, performance and problems related to transnational private labour regulation, their interactions on the transnational level and local level compliance. Stepping back from conventional debates on the overall effectiveness of transnational private governance, the project focuses instead on agency: the effect of transnational private labour regulation on the capacity of those involved, especially workers, to act in local contexts. With our project, we explore how different types of transnational private labour regulation, different national settings and different firm-level contexts of application combine to form what we call transnational hybrid production regimes.AimThe study examines how these regimes support workers’ collective capacity to take action to improve their own conditions of employment.;Graz, Jean-Christophe;10.23662/FORS-DS-1180-1;2020-07-08T00:00:00Z;https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/16999/0/;FORSBase;" Survey among workers, managers and union representatives from companies of export-oriented industries in Kenya and Brazil (2018-2020)";799B650A-33DA-42BB-B289-AB3EE3F49CFC;162647

Ho2Ti2O7 is the prototypical spin ice, but lacks sizeable quantum dynamics. Following a theoretical study, we propose to investigate possible disorder-induced Quantum Spin Liquids. In this quantum spin ices, low-energy excitations are expected, which is in stark contrast with their classical counterparts. In Ho2(Ti0.9Hf0.1)2O7, our experimental observations corroborate the persistence of spin ice correlations along with strengthened fluctuations due to disorder-induced transverse fields. We propose to measure the excitations in a Ho2(Ti0.9Hf0.1)2O7 single crystal. This experiment would thus provide a clear demonstration of a QSI in a material based on a large dipole moment and where, therefore, the signatures will be easier to track than in typical QSI candidates based on small moments such as Pr3+ compounds.;Sibille, Romain;10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-833;2021-01-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.ill.fr/10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-833;Institute Laue–Langevin data portal;Excitations in new disorder-induced quantum spin ice Ho2(Ti0.9Hf0.1)2O7;03F31C97-D553-4254-BBCF-A71477591331;179150

The connection of a sterically constrained 3-methyl-pyrazine ring to a N-methyl-benzimidazole unit to give the unsymmetrical α,α’-diimine ligand L5 has been programmed for the design of pseudo-octahedral spin-crossover [Fe(L5)3]2+ units, the transition temperature (T1/2) of which occurs in between those reported for related facial tris-didentate iron chromophores fitted with 3-methyl-pyridine-benzimidazole in a LaFe helicate (T1/2 ~ 50 K) and with 5-methyl-pyrazine-benzimidazole L2 ligands (T1/2 ~350 K). A thorough crystallographic analysis of [Fe(L5)3](ClO4)2 (I), [Ni(L5)3](ClO4)2 (II), [Ni(L5)3](BF4)2∙H2O (III), [Zn(L5)3](ClO4)2 (IV), [Ni(L5)3](BF4)2∙1.75CH3CN (V), and [Zn(L5)3](BF4)2∙1.5CH3CN (VI) shows the selective formation of pure facial [M(L5)3]2+ cations in the solvated crystals of the tetrafluoroborate salts and alternative meridional isomers in the perchlorate salts. Except for a slightly larger intra-strand interannular twist between the aromatic heterocycles in L5, the metric parameters measured in [Zn(L5)3]2+ are comparable to those reported for [Zn(L2)3]2+, where L2 is the related unconstrained ligand. This similitude is reinforced by comparable ligand-field strengths (∆oct) and nephelauxetic effects (as measured by the Racah parameters B and C) extracted from the electronic absorption spectra recorded for [Ni(L5)3]2+ and [Ni(L2)3]2+. In this context, the strictly high-spin behavior observed for [Fe(L5)3]2+ within the 5-300 K range contrasts with the close to room-temperature spin-crossover behavior of [Fe(L2)3]2+ (T1/2 = 349(5) K in acetonitrile). This can be unambiguously assigned to an intraligand arm wrestling match operating in bound L5, which prevents the contraction of the coordination sphere required for accommodating low-spin FeII. Since the analogous 3-methyl-pyridine ring in [Fe(L3)3]2+ derivatives are sometimes compatible with spin-crossover properties, the consequences of repulsive intra-strand methyl-methyl interactions are found to be amplified in [Fe(L5)3]2+ because of the much lower basicity of the 3-methyl-pyrazine ring and the resulting weaker thermodynamic compensation. The decrease of the stability constants by five orders of magnitude observed in going from [M(L2)3]2+ to [M(L5)3]2+ (M = NiII and ZnII) is diagnostic for the operation of this effect, which had been not foreseen by the authors.;"Besnard, Céline; Deorukhkar, Neel; Guénée, Laure; Lathion, Timothée; Piguet, Claude";ORCID iD: 0000-0001-7064-8548;2020-06-02T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3764730#.XrkaGMBS9aR;Zenodo;The Tyranny of Arm-Wrestling Methyls on Iron(II) Spin State in Pseudo-Octahedral [Fe(didentate)3] Complexes;EBC5E5AC-23E6-482C-9099-E120210E1C6F;178758

"This data set contains samples of long-term invasive recordings (iEEG) from 20 patients who subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery.  Recordings were made using subdural strip and grid electrodes as well as depth electrodes.  From each night recording, up to six sample intervals, each containing five minutes of interictal slow-wave sleep were selected for inclusion in the data set. In the sample intervals we detected high frequency oscillations (HFO) and the start and ending times of these events are included in the data set.  The HFO events were detected using a previously validated, automated algorithm (Burnos et al., 2016) in the ripple (80-250 Hz) and the fast ripple (FR, 250-500 Hz) frequency band.  Contacts with the highest rate of ripples co-occurring with FR over several five-minute time intervals designated the HFO area.The motivation for collecting these data is that high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are recognized as biomarkers for epileptogenic brain tissue. A remaining challenge for epilepsy surgery is the prospective classification of tissue sampled by individual electrode contacts.   For the 20 patients from which this data was collected, it was shown that resection of the prospectively defined HFO area proved to be highly specific and reproducible in 13/13 patients with seizure freedom, while it may have improved the outcome in 4/7 patients with recurrent seizures.

The written and spoken digits database is not a new database but a constructed database from existing ones, in order to provide a ready-to-use database for multimodal fusion [1].The written digits database is the original MNIST handwritten digits database [2] with no additional processing. It consists of 70000 images (60000 for training and 10000 for test) of 28 x 28 = 784 dimensions.The spoken digits database was extracted from Google Speech Commands [3], an audio dataset of spoken words that was proposed to train and evaluate keyword spotting systems. It consists of 105829 utterances of 35 words, amongst which 38908 utterances of the ten digits (34801 for training and 4107 for test). A pre-processing was done via the extraction of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with a framing window size of 50 ms and frame shift size of 25 ms. Since the speech samples are approximately 1 s long, we end up with 39 time slots. For each one, we extract 12 MFCC coefficients with an additional energy coefficient. Thus, we have a final vector of 39 x 13 = 507 dimensions. Standardization and normalization were applied on the MFCC features.To construct the multimodal digits dataset, we associated written and spoken digits of the same class respecting the initial partitioning in [2] and [3] for the training and test subsets. Since we have less samples for the spoken digits, we duplicated some random samples to match the number of written digits and have a multimodal digits database of 70000 samples (60000 for training and 10000 for test).The dataset is provided in six files as described below. Therefore, if a shuffle is performed on the training or test subsets, it must be performed in unison with the same order for the written digits, spoken digits and labels.;Miramond , Benoit;10.5281/zenodo.4452953;2020-10-01T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/4452953#.YV1qDXvRaV5;Zenodo;Written and spoken digits database for multimodal learning;F1BA3256-3D1A-4DAE-95C4-AB503D16582C;175720

Here we present semi-continuous and real-time measurements of elemental composition for PM2.5 and PM10 aerosols in Delhi, India, at a time resolution of 30 min to 1 h during two consecutive winters in 2018 and 2019, to identify the prevailing sources. Nine different aerosol sources were identified during both winters using positive matrix factorization (PMF), including dust, brake wear, a S-rich factor, two solid fuel combustion (SFC) factors and four industrial/combustion factors related to plume events (Cr-30 Ni-Mn, Cu-Cd-Pb, Pb-Sn-Se and Cl-Br-Se). Most of these sources had the highest relative contributions during late night (22:00 local time (LT)) and early morning hours (between 03:00 to 08:00 LT), which is consistent with enhanced emissions into a shallow boundary layer. Modelling of airmass source geography revealed that the pollutants enter Delhi via three distinct air corridors during winters including Nepal and Uttar Pradesh (India) in the east, and Pakistan, Punjab (India) and Haryana (India) in the north-west, during winter, when the national capital’s air quality is at its worst.;Rai, Pragati;10.5281/zenodo.3907250;2020-06-25T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/3907250#.YAbSBDpKiUk;Zenodo;Real-time measurement and source apportionment of elements in Delhi's atmosphere;FB3DBABD-3F19-4BD4-AB0D-54E36AD789AF;162448

Parametrization of small organic molecules for classical molecular dynamics simulations is not trivial. The vastness of the chemical space makes approaches using building blocks challenging. The most common approach is therefore an invidual parametrization of each compound by deriving partial charges from semi-empirical or ab initio calculations and inheriting the bonded and van der Waals (Lennard-Jones) parameters from a biomolecular force field. The quality of the partial charges generated in this fashion depends on the level of the quantum-chemical calculation as well as on the extraction procedure used. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based approach for predicting partial charges extracted from density functional theory (DFT) electron densities. The training set was chosen with the goal to provide a broad coverage of the known chemical space of drug-like molecules. In addition to the speed of the approach, the partial charges predicted by ML are not dependent on the molecular conformation in contrast to the ones obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP).;Riniker, Sereina;https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000230799;2018-01-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/230799;ETH Research Collection;Training Set for the Prediction of Partial Charges;7C599A9C-A544-4D91-A0FD-58EB6E9650BF;159713

Purpose: We performed a time-course single-cell RNA-seq of the somatic cells of the XX mouse gonads to study the cell population heterogeneity and the genetic program during their differentiation.Methods: We collected gonads from NR5A1-eGFP transgenic embryos at six embryonic stages: E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E16.5 and P6.Methods: Cells were capture with the C1 autoprep system and cDNA sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2000.Results: One cell population was detected at E10.5 and give rise to both Granulosa and steroidogenic precursor cells. A precursor cell population remains undifferentiated at P6 and are likely to be theca cell precursors.Conclusion: Our study is, to date, the most granular transcriptomic study of the developing mouse ovary and provide a more complete model of somatic cell differentiation during female sex determination.;Nef, Serge;GSE119766;2018-12-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119766;GEO GSE119766;Single-cell RNA-seq of NR5A1-eGFP positive cells of the developing mouse ovary from E10.5 to P6;60FD6CA0-A2B0-403D-A4FB-AE1F8F07F023;173070

Identifying traits that underlie variation in individual performance of consumers (i.e. trait utility) can help reveal the ecological causes of population divergence, and the subsequent consequences for species interactions and community structure. Here, we document a case of rapid divergence (over the past 100 generations or ~150 years) in foraging traits and feeding efficiency between a lake and stream population pair of threespine stickleback. Building on predictions from functional trait models of fish feeding, we analyzed foraging experiments with a Bayesian path analysis and elucidated the traits explaining variation in foraging performance and the species composition of ingested prey. Despite extensive previous research on the divergence of foraging traits among populations and ecotypes of stickleback, our results provide novel experimental evidence of trait utility for jaw protrusion, gill raker length, and gill raker spacing when foraging on a natural zooplankton assemblage. Furthermore, we discuss how these traits might contribute to the differential effects of lake and stream stickleback on their prey communities, observed in both laboratory and mesocosm conditions. More generally, our results illustrate how the rapid divergence of functional foraging traits of consumers can impact the biomass, species composition, and trophic structure of prey communities.;Schmid, Dominik;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8rk23t4;2020-11-02T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8rk23t4;Dryad;Data from: Rapid divergence of predator functional traits affects prey composition in aquatic communities;9370E9C3-B344-4768-9751-950D60D81DD2;175614

The RAF kinase inhibitor protein, RKIP, is a dual inhibitor of the RAF1 kinase and the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). By inhibition of the proto-oncogenic and pro-survival RAF1-MAPK pathway, the RAF kinase inhibitor protein, RKIP, acts as a tumor suppressor, which enhances cardiomyocyte death and promotes the development of symptoms of heart failure. To elucidate pathomechanisms of heart failure induced by RKIP, the study determined the cardiac transcriptomes of eight-month-old, male, transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of RKIP (PEBP1) under control of the myocardium-specific, alpha-MHC promoter. In addition, the study determined the cardiac transcriptomes of GRK2-transgenic mice. Tg-GRK2 mice have a slightly increased transgenic expression of GRK2. According to NGS data, cardiac GRK2-Grk2 transcript levels of Tg-GRK2 mice are 1.59±0.10-fold higher than those of non-transgenic FVB hearts. In Tg-GRK2 mice, transgenic GRK2 is expressed under control of the ubiquitous CMV immediate-early promoter/enhancer. The non-transgenic control group are age-matched, male, nontransgenic FVB/N mice. NGS data of this study document transcriptome changes underlying the heart failure phenotype induced by transgenic RKIP expression and cardiac degeneration induced by GRK2 expression.;"Abd Alla, Joshua; Quitterer, Ursula";GSE191316;2021-12-27T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE191316;NCBI GEO;Cardiac transcriptome analysis of RKIP-transgenic and GRK2-transgenic mice by NGS;4BA65DF2-5D50-4BCA-B437-4D0C862B3CCB;169354

Abstract The LIM domain-dependent localization of the adapter protein paxillin to β3 integrin-positive focal adhesions (FAs) is not mechanistically understood. Here, by combining molecular biology, photoactivation and FA-isolation experiments, we demonstrate specific contributions of each LIM domain of paxillin and reveal multiple paxillin interactions in adhesion-complexes. Mutation of β3 integrin at a putative paxillin binding site (β3 VE/YA ) leads to rapidly inward-sliding FAs, correlating with actin retrograde flow and enhanced paxillin dissociation kinetics. Induced mechanical coupling of paxillin to β3 VE/YA integrin arrests the FA-sliding, thereby disclosing an essential structural function of paxillin for the maturation of β3 integrin/talin clusters. Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation unveils the spatial orientation of the paxillin LIM-array, juxtaposing the positive LIM4 to the plasma membrane and the β3 integrin-tail, while in vitro binding assays point to LIM1 and/or LIM2 interaction with talin-head domain. These data provide structural insights into the molecular organization of β3 integrin-FAs.;"Azizi, Latifeh; Bouvard, Daniel; Hytönen, Vesa P.; Liaudet, Nicolas; Ripamonti, Marta; Wehrle-Haller, Bernhard";10.26037/yareta:23jacb27ibdm5erlqxcdluzwrm;2021-02-03T00:00:00Z;https://yareta.unige.ch/#/home/detail/81a01062-aea3-4d2b-a26d-7181cc18cf9a;Yareta.unige.ch;Structural and functional analysis of LIM domain-dependent recruitment of paxillin to αvβ3 integrin-positive focal adhesions;69D9266B-099C-499D-AC92-2D407BBF72B1;166384

Engaging the nucleosome Cell identity is defined by gene expression patterns that are established through the binding of specific transcription factors. However, nucleosomal units limit access of transcription factors to specific DNA motifs within the mammalian genome. To study how transcription factors bind such chromatinized, nucleosome-embedded motifs, Michael et al. focused on the pluripotency factors OCT4 and SOX2. They systematically quantified the relative affinities of these factors at different motif positions throughout the nucleosome, enabling structure determination of OCT4-SOX2-bound nucleosomes by cryo-electron microscopy. OCT4 and SOX2 bound cooperatively to strengthen DNA-binding affinity and resulted in DNA distortions that destabilized the nucleosome. This analysis reveals position-dependent binding modes that were validated in vivo, providing insights on how transcription factors read out chromatinized motifs.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited skeletal dysplasia characterized by low bone density, bone fragility and recurrent fractures. The characterization of its heterogeneous genetic basis has allowed the identification of novel players in bone development. In 2016, we described the first X-linked recessive form of OI caused by hemizygous MBTPS2 missense variants resulting in moderate to severe phenotypes. MBTPS2 encodes site-2 protease (S2P), which activates transcription factors involved in bone (OASIS) and cartilage development (BBF2H7), ER stress response (ATF6) and lipid metabolism (SREBP) via regulated intramembrane proteolysis. In times of ER stress or sterol deficiency, the aforementioned transcription factors are sequentially cleaved by site-1 protease (S1P) and S2P. Their N-terminal fragments shuttle to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. Intriguingly, missense mutations at other positions of MBTPS2 cause the dermatological spectrum condition Ichthyosis Follicularis, Atrichia and Photophobia (IFAP) and Keratosis Follicularis Spinulosa Decalvans (KFSD) without clinical overlap with OI despite the proximity of some of the pathogenic variants. To understand how single amino acid substitutions in S2P can lead to non-overlapping phenotypes, we aimed to compare the molecular features of MBTPS2 -OI and MBTPS2 -IFAP/KFSD, with the ultimate goal to unravel the pathomechanisms underlying MBTPS2 -OI. RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome profiling of primary skin fibroblasts from healthy controls ( n = 4), MBTPS2 -OI ( n = 3), and MBTPS2- IFAP/KFSD ( n = 2) patients was performed to identify genes that are differentially expressed in MBTPS2 -OI and MBTPS2- IFAP/KFSD individuals compared to controls. We observed that SREBP-dependent genes are more downregulated in OI than in IFAP/KFSD. This is coupled to alterations in the relative abundance of fatty acids in MBTPS2 -OI fibroblasts in vitro , while no consistent alterations in the sterol profile were observed. Few OASIS-dependent genes are suppressed in MBTPS2 -OI, while BBF2H7- and ATF6-dependent genes are comparable between OI and IFAP/KFSD patients and control fibroblasts. Importantly, we identified genes involved in cartilage physiology that are differentially expressed in MBTPS2- OI but not in MBTPS2 -IFAP/KFSD fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data provide clues to how pathogenic MBTPS2 mutations cause skeletal deformities via altered fatty acid metabolism or cartilage development that may affect bone development, mineralization and endochondral ossification.;"Giunta, Cecilia; Haas, Dorothea; Hersberger, Martin; Langhans, Claus-Dieter; Lim, Pei Jin; Lindert, Uschi; Marfurt, Severin; Ndarugendamwo, Timothée; Opitz, Lennart; Poms, Martin; Rohrbach, Marianne; Srikanthan, Pakeerathan";PRJEB42767;2021-05-21T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/text-search?query=PRJEB42767;The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) part of the ELIXIR infrastructure;Omics Profiling of S2P Mutant Fibroblasts as a Mean to Unravel the Pathomechanism and Molecular Signatures of X-Linked MBTPS2 Osteogenesis Imperfecta;E298F3DF-7AC5-4157-8F1B-29B2C03ABDA7;173183

Cell-cycle transitions are generally triggered by variations in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria parasites express ancestral CDKs and cyclins, whose functions and interdependency remain elusive. Here, we show that the unique Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical cell-cycle regulator of gametogony required for transmission to the mosquito. It is essential for DNA replication and phosphorylates canonical S/TPxK CDK motifs on components of the pre-replicative complex otherwise regulated by distinct kinases in other eukaryotes. Over a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Haemosporidia-specific cyclin (SOC2) with no evidence of SOC2 degradation. Regulation of CRK5 activity relies instead on dynamic phosphorylation of a C-terminus extension that mediates its interaction with SOC2. Our results present evidence that during the atypical cell cycles of Plasmodium gametogony, a unique and divergent cyclin/CDK pair fulfils the functional space of multiple eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases to initiate DNA replication.;"Brochet, Mathieu; Hainard, Alexandre";PXD017283;;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD017283;PRIDE;A unique and divergent cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex controls DNA replication during atypical cell-cycles of Plasmodium berghei gametogony;B7143992-55D3-420D-8A71-36CF2ADBB9CF;179321

AbstractTelomere shortening can cause detrimental diseases and contribute to aging. It occurs due to the end replication problem in cells lacking telomerase. Furthermore, recent studies revealed that telomere shortening can be attributed to difficulties of the semi-conservative DNA replication machinery to replicate the bulk of telomeric DNA repeats. To investigate telomere replication in a comprehensive manner, we develop QTIP-iPOND - Quantitative Telomeric chromatin Isolation Protocol followed by isolation of Proteins On Nascent DNA - which enables purification of proteins that associate with telomeres specifically during replication. In addition to the core replisome, we identify a large number of proteins that specifically associate with telomere replication forks. Depletion of several of these proteins induces telomere fragility validating their importance for telomere replication. We also find that at telomere replication forks the single strand telomere binding protein POT1 is depleted, whereas histone H1 is enriched. Our work reveals the dynamic changes of the telomeric proteome during replication, providing a valuable resource of telomere replication proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the replisome at a specific region of the genome.;"Lin, Chih-Yi Gabriela; Lingner, Joachim; Lossaint, Gérald; Lunardi, Thomas; Näger, Anna Christina; Vančevska, Aleksandra";PXD018712;2021-12-02T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD018712;PRIDE;The human telomeric proteome during telomere replication;61ED4EC1-22C7-47AE-A8B0-B27B12454277;184718

Oviductal extracellular vesicles (oEVs) are emerging as key players in gamete/embryo-oviduct interactions contributing to successful pregnancy. Various positive effects of oEVs on gametes and early embryos have been found in vitro. To find out if these effects are associated with changes of embryonic gene expression, the embryonic transcriptome was analyzed after supplementation of bovine embryos with bovine oEVs during in vitro culture (IVC) in comparison to corresponding controls without oEVs. Embryos were cultured during 7 days of IVC with fresh oEVs, oEVs frozen after isolation from oviductal fluid or without oEVs (control), since a previous study showed different effects of fresh and frozen oEVs. Five pools of 10-14 embryos were analyzed for each group by low-input Illumina RNA-sequencing. Analysis of differential gene expression revealed 221 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for the comparison of frozen oEVs vs control, 67 DEGs for fresh vs frozen oEVs, and only minor differences for the comparison fresh oEVs vs control (28 DEGs). An integrative analysis with the previously studied mRNA and small ncRNA content of bovine oEVs suggested direct effects of oEVs content on the embryonic transcriptome for the supplementation with frozen oEVs, i.e., increase of transcripts found in higher concentrations in oEVs and decrease of transcripts which are potential targets of miRNAs found in oEVs.Overall design Supplementation of bovine embryos during in vitro culture with fresh or frozen bovine oviductal EVs and untreated controls, low-input total RNA-seq of 5 replicates (pools of 8-14 embryos) per group using Illumina HiSeq 2500.;"Almiñana, Carmen; Bauersachs, Stefan";GSE143596;2020-03-21T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143596;NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus;Effects of treatment with bovine oviductal extracellular vesicles on the transcriptome of bovine day 7 in vitro produced embryos;93779C49-948B-4E3F-BB60-520A691A1995;173171
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified in the uterine fluid in different species and pointed as key players in the embryo-maternal dialogue, maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) and establishment of pregnancy. However, little is known about the uterine EVs in the mare. Therefore, the present study aimed at characterizing EVs from uterine lavage of cyclic mares by comparing five EVs isolation methods and the combination of them: (1) Ultracentrifugation (UC); (2) Concentration of lavage volume by Centricon ultrafiltration (CE); (3) the use of CE with different washing steps (PBS versus trehalose); (4) Size-exclusion chromatography with iZON-qEV columns to yield high-purity EVs and (5) a combination of the methods with best results based on EVs yield, purity, and protein cargo profiles. Transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting confirmed the isolation of EVs by all methods but with quantitative and qualitative differences. Mass spectrometry provided different protein profiles among methods with marked differences in the number of proteins and protein classes. Our results indicate that the combination of CE/trehalose/iZON/UC is an optimal method to isolate equine uterine EVs with good yield and purity that can be applied in future studies to determine the role of uterine EVs during MRP in the mare.";Fröhlich, Thomas;PXD022264;2021-09-09T00:00:00Z;http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD022264;PRIDE;Isolation and characterization of equine uterine extracellular vesicles: a comparative methodological study;9D9321A6-1A99-4877-9EA3-B66E62182B71;173171

The results of endometrial gene expression studies during the time of conceptus migration (Days 8 to 16) did not provide final conclusions on possible mechanisms of maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) in the mare. This finding called for the analysis of cell type-specific gene expression in the endometrium in response to the equine embryo, which could be the key for improved understanding of gene expression regulation in context of MRP. In a pilot study, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to collect samples of the luminal epithelium (LE), glandular epithelium (GE), and stroma from endometrial biopsies taken from five mares on Day 12 of pregnancy and Day 12 of the estrous cycle, respectively. RNA was isolated from the LCM samples in order to perform RNA sequencing. Data analysis showed that gene expression differences were greater between cell types than between pregnant and cyclic state. Differential gene expression between pregnant and cyclic state was mainly found in the LE but also in GE and stroma. The comparison with a previous RNA-Seq data set for whole biopsy samples derived from Day 12 of pregnancy revealed the specific origin of the observed gene expression differences. Furthermore, we found that a number of genes are specifically differentially expressed (DE) in only one cell type. Some genes not DE when looking at the whole biopsy were DE in one cell type and showed similar levels in the other cell types in comparison of pregnancy and cyclic stage. Overall, this study revealed new and important spatial information about endometrial gene expression during the phase of initial recognition of pregnancy in the mare. The results indicated induction of angiogenesis and blood vessel development by the presence of the conceptus, a specific spatial regulation of the immune system, spatial regulation of growth factors controlling cell differentiation and endometrial remodeling, and regulation of genes involved in production of prostaglandin (PG) precursors, PG transport, and PG receptors, specifically PTGFR in context of prevention of luteolysis. Furthermore, these results support our hypothesis of the existence of a specific response in different endometrial cell types in the mare and call for further studies.Overall design: Messenger RNA profiles of laser capture microdissection samples (luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium, stroma) from equine endometrial biopsies collected on Day 12 of pregnancy and Day 12 of estrous cycle, respectively, from in total 6 healthy mares were generated by RNA-sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500.;"Bauersachs, Stefan; Scaravaggi, Iside";GSE112236;2018-09-30T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112236;NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus;Cell type-specific endometrial transcriptome changes in comparison of equine endometrium samples collected on Day 12 of pregnancy and Day 12 of the estrous cycle;0C2F9A2D-3C35-44B5-B0E0-977899915084;173171
Specific collagens and insoluble proteins called cuticlins are major constituents of the nematode cuticles. The epicuticle, which forms the outermost electron-dense layer of the cuticle, is composed of another category of insoluble proteins called epicuticlins. It is distinct from the insoluble cuticlins localized in the cortical layer and the fibrous ribbon underneath lateral alae. Our objective was to identify and characterize genes and their encoded proteins forming the epicuticle. The combination between previously obtained laboratory results and recently made available data through the whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS) and the transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequencing projects of Ascaris suum allowed us to identify the first epicuticlin gene, Asu-epic-1, on the chromosome VI. This gene is formed of exon1 (55 bp) and exon2 (1067 bp), separated by an intron of 1593 bp. Exon 2 is formed of tandem repeats (TR) whose number varies in different cDNA and genomic clones of Asu-epic-1. These variations could be due to slippage of the polymerases during DNA replication and RNA transcription leading to insertions and deletions (Indels). The deduced protein, Asu-EPIC-1, consists of a signal peptide of 20 amino acids followed by 353 amino acids composed of seven TR of 49 or 51 amino acids each. Three highly conserved tyrosine motifs characterize each repeat. The GYR motif is the Pfam motif PF02756 present in several cuticular proteins of arthropods. Asu-EPIC-1 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) containing seven predicted molecular recognition features (MoRFs). This type of protein undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding protein partners. Three epicuticular sequences have been identified in A. suum, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Toxocara canis. Homologous epicuticular proteins were identified in over 50 other nematode species. The potential of this new category of proteins in forming the nematode cuticle through covalent interactions with other cuticular components, particularly with collagens, is discussed. Their localization in the outermost layer of the nematode body and their unique structure render them crucial candidates for biochemical and molecular interaction studies and targets for new biotechnological and biomedical applications.;Betschart, Bruno;10.5061/dryad.fttdz08vs;2022-09-07T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.fttdz08vs;Dryad;Identification and characterization of epicuticular proteins of nematodes sharing motifs with cuticular proteins of arthropods;4857687A-6EF1-4DFE-A1D2-2D1958B6AD70;47194

"or the investigation of microstructural and mechanical properties of snow unconfined compression experiments and 3D computed tomography (CT) imaging were performed on sintered rounded grain snow and spherical model snow. The spherical model snow was generated to create geometrically simplified, well-defined microstructures for calibration of numerical models, such as discrete element models (DEM) in which the microstructure is represented by spherical particles.In the experiments, microstructural variation was created by varying the sintering time (contact size) and the density of the ice sphere samples (number of contacts). The 3D CT images allow for a complete reconstruction of the entire experimental sample (cylindrical sample dimension: diameter = 33.6 mm; height = 14 mm).";Willibald, Carolin;10.16904/envidat.83;2019-08-30T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/spherical-model-snow-compression-3dct;EnviDat;"Unconfined compression experiments and 3D CT images of spherical model snow and RG snow samples ";B0AE56B7-215F-44F0-9606-8E3FB6E09A35;162807

"Numerous psychophysical studies show that Bayesian inference governs sensory decision-making; however,the specific neural circuitry underlying this probabilistic mechanism remains unclear.We record extracellularneural activity along the somatosensory pathway of mice while delivering sensory stimulation paradigms designedto isolate the response to the surprise generated by Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate thatlaminar cortical circuits in early sensory areas encode Bayesian surprise. Systematic sensitivity to surprise isnot identified in the somatosensory thalamus, ratheremerging in the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensorycortices. Multiunit spiking activity and evoked potentials in layer 6 of these regions exhibit the highestsensitivity to surprise. Gamma power in S1 layer 2/3 exhibits an NMDAR-dependent scaling with surprise, asdoes alpha power in layers 2/3 and 6 of S2. These results show a precise spatiotemporal neural representationof Bayesian surprise and suggest that Bayesian inference is a fundamental component of cortical processing.";"English, Gwendolyn; Ghasemi Nejad, Newsha; Sommerfelt, Marcel; von der Behrens, Wolfger; Yanik, Mehmet Fatih";10.5281/zenodo.7351494;2022-11-23T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/7351495;Zenodo;Bayesian Surprise Shapes Neural Responses in Somatosensory Cortical Circuit;8CEBB66E-38C8-40A1-BD82-4F875C7B0859;172962
The Quantum Spin Ice (QSI) state, where the two-in-two-out configurations formed by the Ising variables are allowed to tunnel among themselves, is realised in Pr2Hf2O7 based on our last measurements on IN5 (Nature Physics, 14, 711-715 (2018)). The quantum field theory (quantum electrodynamics) that was used to compare with our data, predicts another distinctive feature for this ground state: the suppression of the pinch points, as compared to the sharp anisotropic features observed in classical spin ices, should be progressive as a function of temperature (Phys. Rev. B, 86, 075154 (2012)). We propose to measure this temperature dependence, which will put further limits on the parameters of the theory used to reproduce the experimental data. Moreover, we propose to search for spin-waves in a field-polarised state in order to establish the parameters of the microscopic Hamiltonian that stabilises the zeros-field state. This second part of the experiment is very important as this approached has proved very useful in other rare-earth pyrochlores.;Sibille, Romain;10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-725;2019-01-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.ill.fr/10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-725;Institute Laue–Langevin data portal;Origins of the Quantum Spin Ice state in Pr2Hf2O7;71730BDE-C512-4752-A846-4D0FC9F891A4;179150
Indian-Asian monsoon has oscillated between warm/wet interglacial periods and cool/dry glacial periods with periodicities closely linked to variations in Earth's orbital parameters. However, processes that control wet versus dry, i.e. aridity cyclical periods on the orbital time-scale in the low latitudes of the Indian-Asian continent remain poorly understood because records over millions of years are scarce. The sedimentary record from International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 359 provides a well-preserved, high-resolution, continuous archive of lithogenic input from the Maldives reflecting on low-latitude aridity cycles. Variability within the lithogenic component of sedimentary deposits of the Maldives results from changes in monsoon-controlled sedimentary sources. Here, we present X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core-scanning results from IODP Site U1467 for the past two million years, allowing full investigation of orbital periodicities. We specifically use the Fe/K as a terrestrial climate proxy reflecting on wet versus dry conditions in the source areas of the Indian-Asian landmass, or from further afield. The Fe/K record shows orbitally forced cycles reflecting on changes in the relative importance of aeolian (stronger winter monsoon) during glacial periods versus fluvial supply (stronger summer monsoon) during interglacial periods. For our chronology, we tuned the Fe/K cycles to precessional insolation changes, linking Fe/K maxima/minima to insolation minima/maxima with zero phase lag. Wavelet and spectral analyses of the Fe/K record show increased dominance of the 100 kyr cycles after the Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT) at 1.25 Ma in tandem with the global ice volume benthic δ18O data (LR04 record). In contrast to the LR04 record, the Fe/K profile resolves 100-kyr-like cycles around the 130 kyr frequency band in the interval from 1.25 to 2 million years. These 100-kyr-like cycles likely form by bundling of two or three obliquity cycles, indicating that low-latitude Indian-Asian climate variability reflects on increased tilt sensitivity to regional eccentricity insolation changes (pacing tilt cycles) prior to the MPT. The implication of appearance of the 100 kyr cycles in the LR04 and the Fe/K records since the MPT suggests strengthening of a climate link between the low and high latitudes during this period of climate transition.;"Kunkelova, Theresa; Rüggeberg, Andres; Stainbank, Stephanie";https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-018-0238-x;2018-12-18T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-018-0238-x;Pangea;geochemical data- Excel files;71AC03C8-4915-4621-AEA4-91586BD2BF0E;165852
The ability of an ecosystem to deliver multiple functions at high levels (multifunctionality) typically increases with biodiversity but there is substantial variation in the strength and direction of biodiversity effects, suggesting context-dependency. A better understanding of the drivers of this context dependency is essential to predict effects of global change on ecosystems. To determine how different factors modulate the effect of diversity on multifunctionality, we established a large grassland experiment with 216 communities, crossing a manipulation of plant species richness (1, 4, 8, 20 species) with manipulations of resources (nitrogen enrichment), plant functional composition (gradient in mean specific leaf area [SLA] to manipulate abundances of exploitative, fast-growing vs. conservative, slow-growing species), plant functional diversity (variance in SLA) and enemy abundance (foliar fungal pathogen removal). We measured ten above- and belowground functions, related to productivity, nutrient cycling and energy transfer between trophic levels, and calculated ecosystem multifunctionality. Plant species richness and functional diversity both increased multifunctionality, but their effects were context dependent. Species richness increased multifunctionality only when communities were assembled with fast growing (high SLA) species. This was because slow species were more redundant in their functional effects, whereas different fast species tended to promote different functions. Functional diversity also increased multifunctionality but this effect was dampened by nitrogen enrichment. However, unfertilised, functionally diverse communities still delivered more functions than low diversity, fertilised communities. Our study suggests that a shift towards fast-growing exploitative communities will not only alter ecosystem functioning but also the strength of biodiversity-functioning relationships, which highlights the potentially complex effects of global change on multifunctionality;"Allan, Eric; Cappelli, Seraina; Hölzel, Norbert; Klaus, Valentine; Kleinebecker, Till; Mannall, Tosca; Nwe, Thu Zar; Pichon, Noémie; Soliveres, Santiago; Vincent, Hugo";https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dbrv15f3j;2022-05-24T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dbrv15f3j;Dryad;Nitrogen availability and plant functional composition modify biodiversity-multifunctionality relationships;96B74AA6-344E-4864-B26D-8AA2C97F618C;160212

Abstract Formamidinium lead iodide perovskites are promising light-harvesting materials, yet stabilizing them under operating conditions without compromising optimal optoelectronic properties remains challenging. We report a multimodal host-guest complexation strategy to overcome this challenge using a crown ether, dibenzo-21-crown-7, which acts as a vehicle that assembles at the interface and delivers Cs + ions into the interior while modulating the material. This provides a local gradient of doping at the nanoscale that assists in photoinduced charge separation while passivating surface and bulk defects, stabilizing the perovskite phase through a synergistic effect of the host, guest, and host-guest complex. The resulting solar cells show power conversion efficiencies exceeding 24% and enhanced operational stability, maintaining over 95% of their performance without encapsulation for 500 h under continuous operation. Moreover, the host contributes to binding lead ions, reducing their environmental impact. This supramolecular strategy illustrates the broad implications of host-guest chemistry in photovoltaics.;"Ahlawat, Paramvir; Dong, Zhaowen; Eickemeyer, Felix Thomas; Emsley, Lyndon; Grätzel, Michael; Guo, Jinming; Hagfeldt, Anders; Hinderhofer, Alexander; Hope, Michael A.; Jahanbakhshi, Farzaneh; Krishna, Anurag; Merten, Lena; Milić, Jovana V.; Mishra, Aditya; Mladenović, Marko; Ouellette, Olivier; Ren, Dan; Rothlisberger, Ursula; Schreiber, Frank; Su, Tzu-Sen; Wang, Zaiwei; Zakeeruddin, Shaik M.; Zhang, Hong; Zhou, Zhiwen";10.5281/zenodo.4768098;2021-12-07T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4768098;Zenodo;Multimodal host–guest complexation for efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics;36002B97-3896-4374-921F-85EBE3560789;178860

We prove that the Wadge order on the Borel subsets of the Scott domain is not a well-quasi-order, and that this feature even occurs among the sets of Borel rank at most 2. For this purpose, a specific class of countable 2-colored posets ℙlay equipped with the order induced by homomorphisms is embedded into the Wadge order on the Δ02-degrees of the Scott domain. We then show that ℙlay both admits infinite strictly decreasing chains and infinite antichains with respect to this notion of comparison, which therefore transfers to the Wadge order on the Δ02-degrees of the Scott domain.;"Duparc, Jacques; Vuilleumier, Louis";https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09419v2;2019-02-25T00:00:00Z;https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09419v2;The Wadge order on the Scott domain is not a well-quasi-order;article;88B339CE-8CFE-4724-8F47-2B6B05715DEE;159241

Following a theoretical study, we propose to investigate possible disorder-induced Quantum Spin Liquids. A possible route to tune such disorder is to control the density of Frenkel pair defects in an initially classical pyrochlore spin ice. This can be achieved by admixing quadrivalent cations at the pyrochlore B site. In this spirit, a series of non-Kramers rare-earth pyrochlore was synthesized and characterized using XRD, NPD and magnetic susceptibility. Experimental observations corroborate the persistence of spin ice correlations along with strengthened fluctuations due to disorder-induced transverse fields. A change in the spin dynamics is thus expected, compared to the classical spin ice. This experiment aims at using neutron spin echo spectroscopy on Ho2(Ti0.9Hf0.1)2O7 and compare its dynamics with that of the classical system Ho2Ti2O7.;Sibille, Romain;10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-846;2021-01-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.ill.fr/10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-846;Institute Laue–Langevin data portal;Spin dynamics in hafnium-doped holmium titanate pyrochlore.;6175A042-8A91-483F-AB9A-8F15544172C8;179150

Heterostructures of transition metal oxides perovskites represent an ideal platform to explore exotic phenomena involving the complex interplay between the spin, charge, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom available in these compounds. At the interface between such materials, this interplay can lead to phenomena that are present in none of the original constituents such as the formation of the interfacial two-dimensional electron system (2DES) discovered at the LAO3/STO3 (LAO/STO) interface. In samples prepared by growing a LAO layer onto a STO substrate, the 2DES is confined in a band bending potential well, whose width is set by the interface charge density and the STO dielectric properties, and determines the electronic band structure. Growing LAO (2 nm)/STO (x nm)/LAO (2 nm) heterostructures on STO substrates allows us to control the extension of the confining potential of the top 2DES via the thickness of the STO layer. In such samples, we explore the electronic structure trend under an increase of the confining potential with using soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with ab initio calculations. The results indicate that varying the thickness of the STO film modifies the quantization of the 3dt2g bands and, interestingly, redistributes the charge between the dxy and dxz/dyz bands.;"Boselli, Margherita; Cancellieri, Claudia; Caputo, Marco; Chikina, A.; Filippetti, Alessio; Gariglio, Stefano; Ghosez, Philippe; Lemal, Sébastien; Li, Danfeng; Schmitt, Thorsten; Strocov, Vladimir; Triscone, Jean-Marc";10.26037/yareta:v22m3sedqfbu3bwji6sk6f5wmu;2020-03-09T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:v22m3sedqfbu3bwji6sk6f5wmu;Yareta;Artificial quantum confinement in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures;A40B7D7F-DBCF-4704-864B-0C097F0488B8;179155
In this study, we analyze how the octahedral tilts and rotations of thin films of LaNiO3 and LaAlO3 grown on different substrates, determined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction-measured half-integer Bragg peaks, depend upon the total film thickness. We find a striking difference between films grown on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates which appears to stem not only from the difference in epitaxial strain state but also from the level of continuity at the heterointerface. In particular, the chemically and structurally discontinuous LaNiO3/SrTiO3 and LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces cause a large variation in the octahedral network as a function of film thickness whereas the rather continuous LaNiO3/LaAlO3 interface seems to allow from just a few unit cells the formation of a stable octahedral pattern corresponding to that expected only given the applied biaxial strain.;"Fowlie, Jennifer; Gibert, Marta; Lichtensteiger, Céline; Meley, Hugo; Triscone, Jean-Marc; Willmott, Philip";10.26037/yareta:my3bdfiovfhunannc4slmmikwu;2019-05-22T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:my3bdfiovfhunannc4slmmikwu;Yareta;Thickness-Dependent Perovskite Octahedral Distortions at Heterointerfaces;BB17E72E-E884-4C99-8693-489D3B8A56C5;179155

Altered expression of transient receptor potential channel melastatin 4 (TRPM4) contributes to several malignancies, including cardiac conduction diseases, immune diseases, and cancer. Yet the underlying mechanisms of TRPM4 expression changes remain elusive.In this study, we report that loss of tumor suppressor protein p53 or p63γ function or mutation of a putative p53 response element in the TRPM4 promoter region increase TRPM4 promoter activity in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT 116. In cells that lack p53 expression, we observed increased TRPM4 mRNA and protein levels and TRPM4-mediated Na+ currents. This phenotype can be reversed by transient overexpression of p53. In the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which expresses p53 endogenously, p53 overexpression decreases TRPM4-mediated currents. As in other cancer cells, CRISPRcas9 mediated knockout of TRPM4 in p53 deficient HCT 116 cells results in increased store-operated Ca2+entry. The effect of the TRPM4 knockout is mimicked by p53 mediated suppression of TRPM4 in the parental cell line expressing TRPM4. In addition, a TRPM4 knockout-mediated shift in cell cycle is abolished upon loss of p53.Taken together, these findings indicate that p53 represses TRPM4 expression, thereby altering cellular Ca2+ signaling and that TRPM4 adds to cell cycle shift dependent on p53 signaling.;Kappel, Sven;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6475423;2022-04-21T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/6475423#.YnkETFTP2Uk;Zenodo;p53 alters intracellular Ca2+ signaling through regulation of TRPM4;E312E5F4-E457-4C8D-8BB2-3B113869259C;173155

One of the widely used applications of the popular Cre-loxP method for targeted recombination is the permanent activation of marker genes, such as reporter genes or antibiotic resistance genes, by excision of a preceding transcriptional stop signal. The STOP cassette consists of three identical SV40-derived poly(A) signal repeats and is flanked by two loxP sites. We found that in addition to complete loxP-mediated recombination, limiting levels of the Cre recombinase also cause incomplete recombination of the STOP cassette. Partial recombination leads to the loss of only one or two of the three identical poly(A) repeats with recombination breakpoints always precisely matching the end/start of each poly(A) signal repeat without any relevant similarity to the canonical or known cryptic loxP sequences, suggesting that this type of Cre-mediated recombination is loxP-independent. Incomplete deletion of the STOP cassette results in partial read-through transcription, explaining at least some of the variability often observed in marker gene expression from an otherwise identical locus.;Wenger, Roland;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bk3j9kd7t;2020-06-10T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.bk3j9kd7t;Dryad;Cre-mediated, loxP independent sequential recombination of a tripartite transcriptional stop cassette allows for partial read-through transcription;2EF3059F-8FF7-4BFA-9E4D-44DF3ED97CA3;184813
Angle of repose experiments were performed with different snow types at temperatures between -2 and -40°C. They were used to examine granular snow dynamics on the grain-scale with focus on the role of grain shape and cohesion. The angle of repose was observed by sieving snow onto a round, freestanding base until a stationary heap was formed.This dataset consists of 1) the images of the experimental heaps that were taken to determine the angle of repose, 2) one binary 3D micro computed tomography image of each snow type. The CT images were taken with the SLF micro-CT40 to characterize snow properties and grain shape.The experiments with natural snow types (rounded and faceted grains) and spherical model snow allowed for an examination of the differences in granular properties between natural grain shapes and spherical particles in view of Discrete Element Modelling. With the chosen temperatures, the effect of sintering could be observed that increases the angle of repose with increasing temperature.;Willibald, Carolin;10.16904/envidat.149;2020-04-22T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/angle-of-repose-of-snow;EnviDat;Angle of repose experiments with natural and spherical snow;52DB10FA-8920-427C-B391-48B0C5606CA5;162807

Introduction: High dose irradiation is an essential tool to help control the growth of hepatic tumors, but has the cost of increasing the risk of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). This life-threatening consequence manifests itself months following radiation therapy and is hallmarked by fibrosis of the pericentral sinusoids resulting in sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). In this study, we aimed to establish a mouse model of RILD to use to investigate the underlying mechanism of SOS.Methods: A small animal image-guided RT platform was used to design an irradiation scheme delivering 50Gy as a single dose to a focal point in the liver. Tissues were analyzed 1- and 6- days, 6- and 20-weeks post-irradiation. Liver histology was assessed by H&E and immunohistochemistry. The transcriptome of irradiation livers was analyzed by RNA sequencing and mitochondria function was assessed using high-resolution respirometry.Results:  At 6- and 20-weeks post irradiation, features of SOS were visible in highly irradiated areas, including the presence of ceroid-containing macrophages, matrix deposition around the central veins, and extravasation of red blood cells. The RNAseq analysis showed gene signatures associated with acute DNA damage, cell death, markers of fibrosis and mitochondrial damage and an increase in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy. Mitochondrial damage was verified by a decrease in complex I activity in irradiated hepatocytes in vitro. Finally, highly irradiated areas showed increased lipid peroxides and a senescence-like phenotype associated with the developing fibrosis.Conclusions: Based on our murine model of RILD, we propose irradiation-induced mtDNA instability contributes to the development of SOS by the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species, p53 pathway activation and a senescence-like phenotype.;"Melin, Nicolas; Stroka, Deborah";NA;2022-12-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE179782;GSE179782;"RILD ";DD94ABAC-BFBE-4BF7-9994-A475C3A8FA42;173157

Pyrochlore oxides based on non-Kramers rare-earth ions, such as Pr3+ and Tb3+, are candidate materials for the formation of the Quantum Spin Ice. However, structural disorder is thought to be determinant in the selection of this exotic magnetic ground state. Slight level of disorder can indeed induce transverse fields on the Ising spin variable and turn a classical spin ice into a quantum spin ice. When disorder and thus transverse fields are stronger, the Ising spin variables become essentially electric quadupolar degrees of freedom, and the system remains paramagnetic. It is thus of paramount importance to establish detailed knowledge on the type and density of disorder in such materials. We want to finely characterise disorder in our existing samples of Pr2Zr2O7, Pr2ZHf2O7 and Tb2Hf2O7, for all of which showing signatures of quantum spin physics in low-energy neutron spectroscopy.;Sibille, Romain;10.5286/ISIS.E.RB1910480;2019-07-10T00:00:00Z;https://data.isis.stfc.ac.uk/doi/STUDY/103211601/;ISIS Neutron and Muon Source Data Catalogue;Quantum Spin Ice ground states and Structural Disorder in non-Kramers rare-earth pyrochlores;88A99396-EA81-4B3B-AE3C-0AFC5DBAC7B4;179150
A theoretically predicted Octupolar QSI was found in the Ce2Sn2O7 pyrochlore oxide. The dipole-octupole nature of the ground state doublet explains remarkably well macroscopic measurements. Furthermore, the octupolar nature of the correlations has been observed, taking the shape of a broad hump located at high momentum transfer in neutron diffraction patterns. Unfortunately, the chemistry of Ce2Sn2O7 makes it challenging to grow single crystals to further elucidate the nature of its ground state. However, it is possible for its parent compound, Ce2Hf2O7. Its chemical and physical similarities with Ce2Sn2O7 motivate its investigation as it could withstand undoubtable fingerprints of this Octupolar QSI. We propose to explore the low-lying continuum of excitations present in Ce2Hf2O7 and to track their evolution when entering the correlated regime as well as under the application of a magnetic field.;Sibille, Romain;10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-813;2021-01-16T00:00:00Z;https://doi.ill.fr/10.5291/ILL-DATA.4-05-813;Institute Laue–Langevin data portal;Exploration of Excitations in Cerium Hafnate Pyrochlore Oxide.;65D6243B-F846-45B2-988A-A0527D387225;179150

Subpopulation identification, usually via some form of unsupervised clustering, is a fundamental step in the analysis of many single-cell RNA-seq data sets. This has motivated the development and application of a broad range of clustering methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we provide a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 12 clustering algorithms, including both methods developed explicitly for scRNA-seq data and more general-purpose methods. The methods were evaluated using 9 publicly available scRNA-seq data sets as well as three simulations with varying degree of cluster separability. The same feature selection approaches were used for all methods, allowing us to focus on the investigation of the performance of the clustering algorithms themselves. We evaluated the ability of recovering known subpopulations, the stability and the run time of the methods. Additionally, we investigated whether the performance could be improved by generating consensus partitions from multiple individual clustering methods. We found substantial differences in the performance, run time and stability between the methods, with SC3 and Seurat showing the most favorable results. Additionally, we found that consensus clustering typically did not improve the performance compared to the best of the combined methods, but that several of the top-performing methods already perform some type of consensus clustering.

This catalog presents adjustable stiffness, damping, and impedance elements. Adjustable impedance elements are machine elements that consist of a separately adjustable stiffness mechanism and damping mechanism. The selection catalog gives information about design space, standardized interfaces, degree of freedom, control possibilities, range of frequency, range of stiffness and damping, inertia, load range, displacement, working principle, used material, manufacturing technique, and manufacturing costs. Scientists or developers who are conducting their own research on adjustable impedance elements or who need specific impedance elements for their test benches will be supported in the selection of elements, their design, and their use by this catalog. Future developers of such elements can extend this catalog but are required to fill in the information on all criteria and adhere to the given standardized interfaces.;"Heyden , Emil; Lindenmann, Andreas; Nasrallah Danun, Aschraf";https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7128860;2022-09-30T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/7128860#.Y7VHui9XZhG;ZENODO;Design Catalogue of Adjustable Stiffness, Damping, and Impedance Elements within AIProVE-Project;375F590F-388B-4C34-AF03-E2B63AD0D31F;178689
Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) are a subclass of atmospheric aerosol particles, which can be activated to cloud droplets at a certain supersaturation, with respect to water. Due to their abundance, these particles can affect micro-physical properties of clouds, while acting as CCN. It was found that CCN are relevant for the Earth’s radiation budget, by affecting cloud albedo and lifetime. When giving a number concentration of CCN, also the supersaturation (SS) at which it was measured has to be given. Our dataset gives CCN number concentrations measured by a CCN counter (type CCN-100 by DMT, Boulder, US) operated at five different levels of supersaturation (SS=0.15%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 1%) during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) cruise over the Southern Ocean, as part of the ACE-SPACE project. Temporal coverage is from December 20, 2016 to March 19, 2017.

knockdown enhanced DHRS7 expression in these cells.

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Echinococcus multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a rising zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere. Treatment of this fatal disease is limited to chemotherapy using benzimidazoles and surgical intervention, with frequent disease recurrence in cases without radical surgery. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying E. multilocularis infections and host-parasite interactions ultimately aids developing novel therapeutic options. This study explored an involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS) during E. multilocularis infection in mice.E. multilocularis- and mock-infected C57BL/6 mice were subdivided into vehicle, albendazole (ABZ) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (αPD-L1) treated groups. To mimic a chronic infection, treatments of mice started six weeks post i.p. infection and continued for another eight weeks. Liver tissue was then collected to examine inflammatory cytokines and the expression of UPR- and ERS-related genes.E. multilocularis infection led to an upregulation of UPR- and ERS-related proteins in the liver, including ATF6, CHOP, GRP78, ERp72, H6PD and calreticulin, whilst PERK and its target eIF2α were not affected, and IRE1α and ATF4 were downregulated. ABZ treatment in E. multilocularis infected mice reversed, or at least tended to reverse, these protein expression changes to levels seen in mock-infected mice. Furthermore, ABZ treatment reversed the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ in the liver of infected mice. Similar to ABZ, αPD-L1 immune-treatment tended to reverse the increased CHOP and decreased ATF4 and IRE1α expression levels.AE caused chronic inflammation, UPR activation and ERS in mice. The E. multilocularis-induced inflammation and consecutive ERS was ameliorated by ABZ and αPD-L1 treatment, indicating their effectiveness to inhibit parasite proliferation and downregulate its activity status. Neither ABZ nor αPD-L1 themselves affected UPR in control mice. Further research is needed to elucidate the link between inflammation, UPR and ERS, and if these pathways offer potential for improved therapies of patients with AE.;"Beldi, Guido; Gottstein, Bruno; Jebbawi, Fadi; Lundström-Stadelmann, Britta; Odermatt, Alex; Stücheli, Simon; Wang, Junhua; Weingartner, Michael";10.5281/zenodo.5838159;2022-03-03T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5838159;zenodo;Data_Supplemental_Fig2_Albendazole reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by Echinococcus multilocularis in mice;F20EA5E1-2C8B-45FE-B08F-9B5019B948E3;179400

Argonaute proteins (AGOs), which play an essential role in cytosolic post-transcriptional gene silencing, have been also reported to function in nuclear processes like transcriptional activation or repression, alternative splicing and, chromatin organization. As most of these studies have been conducted in human cancer cell lines, the relevance of AGOs nuclear functions in the context of mouse early embryonic development remains uninvestigated. Here, we examined a possible role of the AGO1 protein on the distribution of constitutive heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We observed a specific redistribution of the repressive histone mark H3K9me3 and the heterochromatin protein HP1α, away from pericentromeric regions upon Ago1 depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that major satellite transcripts are strongly up-regulated in Ago1_ KO mESCs and that their levels are partially restored upon AGO1 rescue. We also observed a similar redistribution of H3K9me3 and HP1α in Drosha _KO mESCs, suggesting a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of heterochromatin distribution in mESCs. Finally, we showed that specific miRNAs with complementarity to major satellites can partially regulate the expression of these transcripts.;"Arora, Rajika; Ciaudo, Constance; Fäh, Tara; Hermes, Victoria; Luitz, Janina; Müller, Madlen; Ngondo, Richard Patryk; Schaefer, Moritz; Stalder, Patrick";10.26508/lsa.202101277;2022-03-02T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80415;GEO;AGO1 regulates pericentromeric regions in mouse embryonic stem cells;3D7D6B93-CB46-48C7-B96C-85CE1371715C;196861

Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) is Ser/Thr protein kinase highly expressed in medulloblastoma (MB) patient samples which promotes cell migration and invasiveness downstream of growth factor receptors. Although MAP4K4 implication in the control of the membrane protrusions at the leading edge of cells during migration and invasion in MB is established, its downstream effectors governing and mediating this process in MB have not been identified. In this study we explored the proteomic neighborhood of MAP4K4 in MB cells and to identify candidate potentially affecting its activity and pro-migratory functions. Towards this aim, we expressed BioID fused versions of MAP4K4 (N- and C-terminal) in DAOY cells under presence of biotin. In the control setup, we expressed the BioID enzyme alone. After Streptavidin purification of biotinylated proteins, we performed mass spectrometry and quantified relative abundances compared to control conditions.;Baumgartner, Martin;PXD031870;2022-08-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD031870;Pride;BioID proximity labelling of MAP4K4 interactors in DAOY medulloblastoma cells;696A4A3D-9847-4237-B8F4-86DBDBD89E8D;165860

Objective.In this modelling study, we pursued two main goals. The first was to establish a new CTV-to-PTV expansion which considers the closest and most critical organ at risk (OAR). The second goal was to investigate the impact of the planning target volume (PTV) margin size on the tumor control probability (TCP) and its dependence on the geometrical setup uncertainties. The aim was to achieve a smaller margin expansion close to the OAR while allowing a moderately larger expansion in less critical areas further away from the OAR and whilst maintaining the TCP.Approach.Imaging data of radiation therapy plans from pet dogs which had undergone radiation therapy for brain tumor were used to estimate the clinic specific rotational setup uncertainties. A Monte-Carlo methodology using a voxel-based TCP model was used to quantify the implications of rotational setup uncertainties on the TCP. A combination of algorithms was utilized to establish a computational CTV-to-PTV expansion method based on probability density. This was achieved by choosing a center of rotation close to an OAR. All required software modules were developed and integrated into a software package that directly interacts with the Varian Eclipse treatment planning system.Main results.Several uniform and non-isotropic PTVs were created. To ensure comparability and consistency, standardized RT plans with equal optimization constraints were defined, automatically applied and calculated on these targets. The resulting TCPs were then computed, evaluated and compared.Significance.The non-isotropic margins were found to result in larger TCPs with smaller margin excess volume. Further, we presented an additional application of the newly established CTV-to-PTV expansion method for radiation therapy of the spinal axis of human patients.;Rohrer Bley, Carla;https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JJGRER;2023-01-05T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JJGRER;Harvard Dataverse;"Replication Data for ""A concept for anisotropic PTV margins...""";BA23CA28-9CAD-4004-B655-8E14818A9DC0;182490

The impact of fermentable and hydrolyzable compounds on already formed AGS was assessed by changing the composition of the influent from simple wastewater containing volatile fatty acids to complex monomeric wastewater containing amino acids and glucose, and then to complex polymeric wastewater containing starch and peptone. The reversibility of the observed changes was assessed by changing the composition of the wastewater from complex monomeric back to simple. The introduction of fermentable compounds in the influent changed dramatically the bacterial community but left the settling properties and nutrient removal performance unchanged, whereas the introduction of polymeric compounds induced small changes in the bacterial community but altered the settling properties and denitrification efficiency. The changes induced by the wastewater transition were only partly reversed. Seven distinct stables states of the bacterial community were detected during the 921 days of experiment, four of them observed with the complex monomeric wastewater. The transitions between these states were not only causes by wastewater changes but also by operation failures and other incidences. However, the nutrient removal performance and settling properties of the AGS were globally maintained due to the functional redundancy of its bacterial community.;Adler, Aline;ERP122292;2020-07-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB38840?show=reads;European Nucleotide Archive (ENA);Project: PRJEB38840;132D4AD2-9BAA-40D2-B518-0920218A6B25;182016
AbstractWe demonstrate memristive functions of the room temperature thermoelectric material Bi-Se fabricated by electrochemical deposition in combination with active electrode Ag-based contacts. We present microfabrication steps for creating polymer molds for the growth of compact memristive films. The electrical measurements show clear forming-free resistive switching behaviour for the electrochemically deposited material while temperature dependent measurements point to Schottky and space-charge-limited-current conduction mechanisms. For the envisioned combination of the memristors with a thermoelectric device we can conclude that electrodeposition is a viable method to produce silver-chalcogenide based non-volatile memristors for co-integration in zero power sensors.;Mihailovic, Ian Alexander;10.3929/ethz-b-000486155;2021-07-29T00:00:00Z;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/486155;https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/;Memristive behaviour of electrodeposited bismuth selenide;D3A3037E-B183-4E11-B528-9CF622A80CDC;178734

Polar discontinuities occurring at interfaces between two materials constitute both a challenge and an opportunity in the study and application of a variety of devices. In order to cure the large electric field occurring in such structures, a reconfiguration of the charge landscape sets in at the interface via chemical modifications, adsorbates, or charge transfer. In the latter case, one may expect a local electronic doping of one material: one example is the two-dimensional electron liquid (2DEL) appearing in SrTiO3 once covered by a polar LaAlO3 layer. Here, it is shown that tuning the formal polarization of a (La,Al)1−x(Sr,Ti)xO3 (LASTO:x) overlayer modifies the quantum confinement of the 2DEL in SrTiO3 and its electronic band structure. The analysis of the behavior in magnetic field of superconducting field-effect devices reveals, in agreement with ab initio calculations and self-consistent Poisson-Schrödinger modeling, that quantum confinement and energy splitting between electronic bands of different symmetries strongly depend on the interface total charge densities. These results strongly support the polar discontinuity mechanisms with a full charge transfer to explain the origin of the 2DEL at the celebrated LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface and demonstrate an effective tool for tailoring the electronic structure at oxide interfaces.;"Boselli, Margherita; Fête, Alexandre; Gariglio, Stefano; Ghosez, Philippe; Lemal, Sébastien; Li, Danfeng; Triscone, Jean-Marc; Wu, Zhenping";10.26037/yareta:67wx2i7mpjg4nh6gjbtroxfdpy;2018-06-24T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:67wx2i7mpjg4nh6gjbtroxfdpy;Yareta;Probing Quantum Confinement and Electronic Structure at Polar Oxide Interfaces;56A8E9E5-7AE5-4465-959F-42EAF70D8321;179155
Numerous studies have shown that animal nutrition is tightly linked to gut microbiota, especially under nutritional stress. In Drosophila melanogaster, microbiota are known to promote juvenile growth, development, and survival on poor diets, mainly through enhanced digestion leading to changes in hormonal signaling. Here, we show that this reliance on microbiota is greatly reduced in replicated Drosophila populations that became genetically adapted to a poor larval diet in the course of over 170 generations of experimental evolution. Protein and polysaccharide digestion in these poor-diet-adapted populations became much less dependent on colonization with microbiota. This was accompanied by changes in expression levels of dFOXO transcription factor, a key regulator of cell growth and survival, and many of its targets. These evolutionary changes in the expression of dFOXO targets to a large degree mimic the response of the same genes to microbiota, suggesting that the evolutionary adaptation to poor diet acted on mechanisms that normally mediate the response to microbiota. Our study suggests that some metazoans have retained the evolutionary potential to adapt their physiology such that association with microbiota may become optional rather than essential.;"Erkosar, Berra; Kawecki, Tadeusz";doi:10.5061/dryad.td3r1;;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.td3r1;Dryad;Data from: Adaptation to chronic nutritional stress leads to reduced dependence on microbiota in Drosophila melanogaster;231CB8FC-3264-480A-BAEB-695096D5E3A0;162732

Koopmans' spectral  functionals aim to describe simultaneously ground state properties and charged excitations of atoms, molecules, nanostructures and periodic crystals. This is achieved augmenting standard density functionals with simple but physically motivated orbital-density-dependent corrections. These corrections act on a set of localized orbitals that, in periodic systems, resembles maximally localized Wannier function. At variance with a direct supercell implementation, we discuss here i) the complex but efficient formalism required for a periodic-boundary code using explicit Brillouin zone sampling, and ii) the calculation of the screened Koopmans' corrections with density-functional perturbation theory. In addition to delivering improved scaling with system size, the present development makes the calculation of band structures with Koopmans functionals straightforward. The implementation in the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution and the application to prototypical insulating and semiconducting systems are presented and discussed.;Colonna, Nicola;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:b5-8r;2022-07-22T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:b5-8r;Materials Cloud;Koopmans spectral functionals: an open-source periodic-boundary implementation;ECEBD84B-CB15-4922-9A81-27981DF87872;179138

Lava, dyke and volcanic glass samples from across the northern Semail ophiolite were collected to provide references for geological mapping of the Semail volcanic units. These samples were analysed by various geochemical means to assign them to a volcanic unit. In addition, the bulk rock magnetic properties of a subset of these samples were determined to aid interpretation of existing aeromagnetic data. The whole-rock major element and select trace element (Ba, Sr, Zr, Y, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, V, Sc) composition of the majority of these samples was determined by X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) at ETH Zürich using a PANalyticalTM Axios wavelength-dispersive instrument. Trace elements in a subset of these samples were further analysed by pressed-powder-pellet laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry (PPP-LA-ICP-MS) using a GeoLas-Pro 193 nm ArF Excimer™ laser system in combination with an ELAN DRC-e™ quadrupole mass spectrometer at the University of Bern. Where necessary for unit assignment, igneous clinopyroxenes in another subset of samples were measured by Electron microprobe (EMP) on a JeolTM JXA-8200 EMP at the University of Bern. A set of volcanic glasses were also analysed by EMP on the same instrument. Bulk magnetic susceptibility was determined by two methods: a handheld Exploranium KT-5 kappameter and a desktop Magnon kappameter at the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM), University of Minnesota. Duplicate analyses of the same samples with both instruments indicates good comparability between the two datasets. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was determined on a 2G Enterprises 760 RF TM SQUID superconducting rock magnetometer at the IRM.;Belgrano, Thomas M.;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.899794;2019-07-29T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.899794;"PANGAEA Data Publisher for Earth & Environmental Science ";Geochemical and rock magnetic data;19D9C5F9-F730-41D1-8F7B-90B7DEA441D8;169653

Organism Mus musculusExperiment type Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingSummary During cortical development, distinct subtypes of glutamatergic neurons are sequentially born and differentiate from dynamic populations of progenitors. How progenitors and their daughter cells are temporally patterned remains unknown. Here, we trace the transcriptional trajectories of successive generations of apical progenitors (APs) and isochronic cohorts of their daughter neurons in the developing mouse neocortex using high temporal resolution parallel single-cell RNA sequencing. We identify and functionally characterize a core set of evolutionarily-conserved temporally patterned genes which drive APs from internally-driven states to more exteroceptive states, revealing a progressively increasing role for extracellular signals as corticogenesis unfolds. These embryonic age-dependent AP molecular states are reflected in their neuronal progeny as successive ground states, onto which essentially conserved early post-mitotic differentiation programs are applied. Thus, temporally unfolding molecular birthmarks present in progenitors act in their post-mitotic progeny as seeds for adult neuronal diversity.  Overall design Investigation of the transcriptional dynamics in time-locked cohorts of cortical cells across embryonic neurogenesis.

"Data and R Code for the paper ""The Role of Attitude Strength in Behavioral Spillover: Attitude Matters-But Not Necessarily as a Moderator"".Studies on how one behavior affects subsequent behaviors find evidence for two opposite trends: Sometimes a first behavior increases the likelihood of engaging in additional behaviors that contribute to the same goal (positive behavioral spillover), and at other times a first behavior decreases this likelihood (negative spillover). A factor that may explain both patterns is attitude strength. A stronger (more favorable) attitude toward an issue may make the connections between related behaviors more salient and increase the motivation to work toward the underlying goal. We predicted that people with a stronger (more favorable) attitude are more likely to engage in subsequent behaviors that address an issue they care about. Two experiments tested the prediction in the contexts of pro-environmental and health behavior. Study 1 (N = 378) provided some support for the predicted moderating role of attitude toward the environment when participants recalled either an environmentally friendly or unfriendly action: A strong attitude increased the likelihood, whereas a weak attitude decreased the likelihood of carrying out successive goal-conducive behaviors. When compared to a neutral control condition in Study 2 (N = 929), participants with a weak environmental attitude supported pro-environmental petitions less strongly after an environmentally harmful action. Support for such petitions did not waver, however, among participants with a strong environmental attitude: They consistently acted environmentally friendly. Contrary to the hypothesis, in neither study did strength of attitude toward personal health moderate the effect of an initial behavior in the expected direction. In sum, the two studies provided only limited evidence for behavioral spillover: Participants mostly acted in accordance with their attitude but were hardly affected by recalling previous actions. When behavioral spillover did occur, however, a strong environmental attitude tended to increase the likelihood of acting in an environmentally friendly way, whereas the behavior of those with a weak attitude was less predictable. This research contributes to a more nuanced theoretical understanding of the role of attitude in spillover, but provides only limited evidence for its role as a moderator.";Brügger, Adrian;DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/MBGXH;2019-05-09T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/mbgxh/;Open Science Framework;The role of attitude strength in behavioral spillover;92AC7EF4-49E8-49C9-9335-8A0367DFE186;159379

"Using a shotgun proteomics approach, the expressed proteome of total membrane fractions of Escherichia coli ATCC25922 cells was analyzed under i) normal growth, and ii) treatment with the novel peptidomimetic JB-95 (a structurally arrested cyclic peptide). By selectively disrupturing the outer membrane (OM), this peptidomimetic displayed a novel mechanism of action and opens new avenues for developing antibiotics that specifically target the OM of Gram-negative bacteria. Escherichia coli ATCC25922 cells were grown in LB medium with or without the peptidomimetic JB-95 (5 ?g/ml), prior to extraction of total membrane fractions by differential ultracentrifugation and further separation of the complex protein mixture on 1-D SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were cut into ten slices; after reduction and carbamidomethylation, the proteins were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were separated by RP-HPLC and analyzed with an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with a nanoelectrospray source. Three biological replicates were analyzed, respectively (the first expt. was analyzed on an Orbitrap XL). Mass spectra were searched against a protein sequence database containing 4104 E. coli K12 (strain MG1655; NC_000913.3) proteins and protein sequences of 256 common contaminants using MS-GF+ (MS-GFDB v9979) and the following parameters: Carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification on all Cysteines, and oxidation of Methionines was considered as optional modification. Spectra were searched for a match to fully-tryptic and semi-tryptic peptides and the automatic decoy search option was enabled. Search results were filtered and summarized using in-house tools. Requiring either three spectra or two distinct unambiguous peptides (class 1a and 3a; Qeli & Ahrens, PeptideClassifier, Nat Biotech 2010), 1740 proteins (at an estimated protein FDR less than 1%; estimated spectral FDR less than 0.1%) were identified in E.coli ATCC25922 under growth with and without exposure to the peptidomimetic JB-95. Significantly differentially regulated proteins were identified with DESeq2 (v1.4.5) applying a Benjamini-Hochberg q-value threshold 0.06 to correct for multiple testing.

Parasites can shape the structure and function of ecosystems by influencing both the density and traits of their hosts. Such changes in ecosystems are particularly likely when the host is a predator that mediates the dynamics of trophic cascades. Here, we experimentally tested how parasite load of a small predatory fish, the threespine stickleback, can affect the occurrence and strength of trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning. In a factorial mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the density of stickleback (low vs. high), and the level of parasite load (natural vs. reduced). In addition, we used two stickleback populations from different lineages: an Eastern European lineage with a more pelagic phenotype (Lake Constance) and a Western European lineage with a more benthic phenotype (Lake Geneva). We found that stickleback caused trophic cascades in the pelagic but not the benthic food chain. Evidence for pelagic trophic cascades was stronger in treatments where parasite load of stickleback was reduced with an antihelmintic medication, and where fish originated from Lake Constance (i.e. the more pelagic lineage). A structural equation model revealed that differences in stickleback lineage and parasite load were most likely to impact trophic cascades via changes in the composition, rather than overall biomass, of zooplankton communities. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence that parasites of predators can influence the cascading effects of fish on lower trophic levels with consequences on ecosystem functioning.;Anaya-Rojas, Jaime;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.34c4889;2019-06-20T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.34c4889;Dryad;Data from: An experimental test of how parasites of predators can influence trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning;044DFF26-922D-4825-9617-AE8D20F53FAC;175614

"1. Studies on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) have elicited debate over the interpretation of the positive relationship between species richness and plant productivity. Manipulating richness cannot be achieved without affecting composition; it is thus essential to consider the latter in statistical models. 2. We firstly review existing approaches that use species richness as an explanatory variable and propose modifications to improve their performance. We use an original dataset to illustrate the analyses. The classical method where composition is coded as a factor with a level for each different species mixture can be improved by defining the levels using clustering. Methods based on ordinations reduce the dimensionality of plant composition and use the new coordinates as fixed effects; they provide a much better fit to our observations. 3. Secondly, we develop a new method where composition is included as a similarity matrix affecting the residual variance-covariance. Similarity in composition between plots is treated in the same way as shared evolutionary history between species in phylogenetic regression. We find that it outperforms the other models. 4. We discuss the different approaches and suggest that our method is particularly suited for observational studies or for manipulative studies where plant diversity is not kept constant by weeding. By treating species composition in an intuitive and sensible way, it offers a valuable and powerful complement to existing models.";Sandau, Nadine;10.5061/dryad.d2v35;2015-06-05T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.d2v35;Dryad;Data from: Including community composition in biodiversity-productivity models;4AB00A4F-D0A6-4181-AD55-21B86941C58A;138489

Nitrogen (N) enrichment has direct effects on ecosystem functioning by altering soil abiotic conditions and indirect effects by reducing plant diversity and shifting plant functional composition from dominance by slow to fast growing species. Litter decomposition is a key ecosystem function and is affected by N enrichment either by a change in litter quality (the recalcitrance of the plant material) or through a change in soil quality (the abiotic and biotic components of the soil that affect decomposition). How the direct and indirect effects of N alter soil and litter quality remains poorly known.We designed a large grassland field experiment manipulating N enrichment, plant species richness and functional composition in a full factorial design. We used three complementary litterbag experiments, combined in a structural equation model (SEM), to quantify the effects of the treatments and various measures of functional composition and diversity on litter and soil quality and overall decomposition.Our results revealed multiple drivers of litter quality and showed that nutrient concentrations (N and calcium) were about twice as important as structural components (leaf dry matter content, fibres) in determining litter quality. Overall the experimental results suggest that N enrichment increases litter decomposition mostly indirectly through a shift in functional composition toward faster growing plant species, producing higher quality litter. N enrichment also altered soil quality and thereby litter decomposition, through its effects on vegetation cover.Our approach provides a mechanistic tool to test the drivers of litter decomposition across different ecosystems. Our results show that litter quality is determined by several nutrient and structure traits and highlight the importance of considering shifts in plant species composition when assessing the effects of N enrichment on decomposition.;"Allan, Eric; Cappelli, Seraina; Hölzel, Norbert; Klaus , Valentin; Kleinebecker, Till; Pichon, Noémie; Soliveres, Santiago";https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.76hdr7ssz;2020-11-24T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.76hdr7ssz;Dryad;Decomposition disentangled: a test of the multiple mechanisms by which nitrogen enrichment alters litter decomposition;BF4B9F5E-D88A-43D7-B46B-145527102AC8;160212
Biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning can be partitioned into complementarity effects, driven by many species, and selection effects, driven by few. Selection effects occur through interspecific abundance shifts (dominance) and intraspecific shifts in functioning. Complementarity and selection effects are often calculated for biomass, but very rarely for secondary productivity, i.e. energy transfer to higher trophic levels. We calculated diversity effects for three functions: aboveground biomass, insect herbivory and pathogen infection, the latter two as proxies for energy transfer to higher trophic levels, in a grassland experiment (PaNDiv) manipulating species richness, functional composition, nitrogen enrichment and fungicide treatment. Complementarity effects were on average positive and selection effects negative for biomass production and pathogen infection and multiple species contributed to diversity effects in mixtures. Diversity effects were on average less pronounced for herbivory. Diversity effects for the three functions were not correlated, because different species drove the different diversity effects. Benefits (and costs) from growing in diverse communities, be it reduced herbivore or pathogen damage or increased productivity either due to abundance increases or increased productivity per area were distributed across different plant species, leading to highly variable contributions of single species to diversity effects on different functions. These results show that different underlying ecological mechanisms can result in similar overall diversity effects across functions.;"Allan, Eric; Cappelli, Seraina; Mannall, Tosca; Pichon, Noémie";https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zs7h44jbp;2022-02-15T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zs7h44jbp;Dryad;Data from: Partitioning the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functions at different trophic levels;9D8962DC-2754-4580-AA79-21F922C677F2;160212

Rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria is needed for rapid diagnostics allowing adequate and timely treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of Secondary Electro-Spray Ionization-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (SESI-HRMS) as a diagnostic tool for rapid detection of bacterial infections and compare its performance with the current standard of diagnostics. We compared the time required to confirm growth of the pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae by conventional detection by culture and MAL-DI-TOF vs. detection of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by these human pathobionts. SESI-HRMS could consistently detect VOCs produced by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae on blood agar plates within minutes, allowing to positively identify bacteria within hours. Unique S. aureus and S. pneumoniae features were detected already at bacterial densities as low as ∼103 colony forming units. Rich mass spectral fingerprints allowed for the distinction of these two bacteria on a species and even strain level. To give an incentive towards clinical application of this technology, further analyzed 17 clinical samples previously diagnosed by conventional methods. We predominantly obtained a separation of samples which showed growth (i.e. presence of living bacteria) compared to samples with no bacterial growth (i.e. presence of dead bacteria). We conclude that SESI-HRMS allows rapid identification of unique bacterial features. Further development of real-time analysis of clinical samples by SESI-HRMS will shorten the time required for microbiological diagnosis with a high level of confidence and sensitivity and should help to improve patient’s tailored treatment.;"Arnold, Kim; Bär, Julian; Brugger, Silvio Daniel; Gómez-Mejia, Alejandro; Scheier, Thomas C.; Singh, Kapil Dev; Sinues, Pablo; Zinkernagel, Annelies S.";https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.16.484604;2022-08-17T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS5085/descriptors;Metabolights;Rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae by real-time analysis of volatile metabolites;A26E7851-FE15-4535-BEAE-B6C52DB90472;173168

Probing the local transport properties of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) confined at buried interfaces requires a non-invasive technique with a high spatial resolution operating in a broad temperature range. In this paper, we investigate the scattering-type scanning near field optical microscopy as a tool for studying the conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface from room temperature down to 6 K. We show that the near-field optical signal, in particular its phase component, is highly sensitive to the transport properties of the electron system present at the interface. Our modeling reveals that such sensitivity originates from the interaction of the AFM tip with coupled plasmon-phonon modes with a small penetration depth. The model allows us to quantitatively correlate changes in the optical signal with the variation of the 2DES transport properties induced by cooling and by electrostatic gating. To probe the spatial resolution of the technique, we image conducting nano-channels written in insulating heterostructures with a voltage-biased tip of an atomic force microscope.;"Ardizzone, Ivan; Boselli, Margherita; Gariglio, Stefano; Kuzmenko, Alexey B.; Luo, Weiwei; Poumirol, Jean-Marie; Teyssier, Jérémie; Triscone, Jean-Marc; van der Marel, Dirk";10.26037/yareta:cgvjv45ogffi3obuwfizlgvfty;2020-12-01T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:cgvjv45ogffi3obuwfizlgvfty;Yareta;High sensitivity variable-temperature infrared nanoscopy of conducting oxide interfaces;9928C868-0CAD-48FF-B30D-78A8E7C5E692;179155
Nanoscale mapping of the distinct electronic phases characterizing the metal-insulator transition displayed by most of the rare-earth nickelate compounds is fundamental for discovering the true nature of this transition and the possible couplings that are established at the interfaces of nickelate-based heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that this can be accomplished by using scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with electron energy-loss spectroscopy. By tracking how the O K and Ni L edge fine structures evolve across two different NdNiO3/SmNiO3 superlattices, displaying either one or two metal-insulator transitions depending on the individual layer thickness, we are able to determine the electronic state of each of the individual constituent materials. We further map the spatial configuration associated with their metallic/insulating regions, reaching unit cell spatial resolution. With this, we estimate the width of the metallic/insulating boundaries at the NdNiO3/SmNiO3 interfaces, which is measured to be on the order of four unit cells.;"Alexander, Duncan T.L.; Dominguez, Claribel; Fowlie, Jennifer; Gibert, Marta; Mundet, Bernat; Triscone, Jean-Marc";10.26037/yareta:b5gpx2lvzjdpjo5pc7upmp3bjy;2021-03-08T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:b5gpx2lvzjdpjo5pc7upmp3bjy;Yareta;Near-atomic-scale mapping of electronic phases in rare earth nickelate superlattices;AF2DAE50-B372-48E4-903D-801D540664A6;179155

"Angesichts der nach wie vor sehr engen Verknüpfung von familialer Herkunft und Bildungslaufbahn in der Schweiz soll das Grundproblem der ungleich verteilten Bildungschancen von Beginn an, das heisst ab Geburt des Kindes bei der Familie als Bildungsort angegangen werden. Zu diesem Zweck wird in der longitudinal angelegten Interventionsstudie ZEPPELIN die Frage untersucht, ob Massnahmen der selektiven primären Prävention ab Geburt die Bildungschancen von Kindern aus Familien in psychosozialen Risikokonstellationen erhöhen. Ausgangslage: In keinem europäischen Land ausser Deutschland sind die Bildungschancen derart eng mit der sozial-familialen Herkunft verbunden wie in der Schweiz (OECD, 2005), und in keinem anderen Land sind die Aussonderungsquoten von Schulkindern aus sozial benachteiligten Familien so hoch (European Agency, 2010). Die in der Schweiz ergriffenen schulischen Massnahmen zur Förderung von Kindern mit ungünstigen Lernvoraussetzungen zeigten bislang nur wenig Wirkung (Moser & Lanfranchi, 2008). Daher soll das Grundproblem der herkunftsbedingten Bildungsdisparitäten bereits im frühkindlichen Alter angegangen werden, weshalb sich unser Fokus auf die Vorbeugung schulischer Lern- und Leistungsstörungen aufgrund ungünstiger Startbedingungen verschiebt. Ins Blickfeld rücken Massnahmen zur frühkindlichen Bildung, Betreuung und Erziehung (FBBE). Bei Kleinkindern geschieht das primär über die Stärkung elterlicher Erziehungskompetenzen. Ziele: ZEPPELIN ist ein Interventionsprojekt der Hochschule für Heilpädagogik Zürich (HfH) in Zusammenarbeit mit der Bildungsdirektion des Kantons Zürich (Amt für Jugend und Berufsberatung, AJB) im Bereich der selektiven primären Prävention. Erstes Ziel im Rahmen der Intervention ist die interdisziplinäre Früherkennung von Kindern, die aus psychosozialen Gründen in ihrer Entwicklung gefährdet und insofern von Behinderung bedroht sind. Das zweite Ziel ist die frühe Förderung dieser Kinder mit dem Programm ""PAT - Mit Eltern lernen"", um ihre Bildungschancen langfristig zu erhöhen. Im Rahmen der Wirkungsevaluation wird geprüft, inwiefern diese beiden Ziele erreicht werden. Fragestellung: In Anlehnung an das PPCT-Design nach Bronfenbrenner und Morris (2006) - in welchem Entwicklung als Interaktion zwischen Person und Umwelt im Kontext sozialräumlicher und zeitlicher Bedingungen aufgefasst wird - steht bei ZEPPELIN 0-3 die Frage im Zentrum, welche Effekte Massnahmen der frühen Förderung auf die Entwicklung von 0 bis 3-jährigen Kindern aus Familien in psychosozialen Risikokonstellationen haben und über welche Wirkmechanismen im Bildungsort Familie allfällige Effekte zum Tragen kommen. Vorgehen Intervention: Aufbauend auf den Erfahrungen aus der (gegenwärtig laufenden) Machbarkeitsstudie ZEPPELIN/M soll in der Hauptstudie ZEPPELIN 0-3 zur Früherkennung von Familien in psychosozialen Risikokonstellationen ein interdisziplinäres Netzwerk implementiert werden, das sich aus Akteuren aus dem medizinischen und psychosozialen Versorgungsfeld zusammensetzt. Zur frühen Förderung dieser Familien haben wir das Programm PAT gewählt, das die wichtigsten Kriterien wirksamer FBBE-Programme erfüllt: a) frühzeitiger Beginn, b) Kontinuität, c) Individualisierungsmöglichkeiten, d) Professionalität des Personals, e) Berücksichtigung der Sprachförderung und f) niederschwelliger Zugang mittels Hausbesuchen. Vorgehen Forschung: Um obige Fragestellung zu beantworten und die Zielerreichung zu überprüfen, ist ZEPPELIN längsschnittlich angelegt. In einer randomisiert kontrollierten Versuchanordnung (RCT) sollen qualitative und quantitative Verfahren eingesetzt werden, um mittels Vergleichen zwischen Interventions- (N=132) und Kontrollgruppe (N=84) Effekte auf die Entwicklung der Kinder und die Wirkmechanismen im Bildungsort Familie zu evaluieren. Folgende Instrumente sind bei ZEPPELIN 0-3 geplant: Zwischen dem 3. und 6. Lebensmonat eine Einschätzung der Belastungs- und Schutzfaktoren; ab dem 3. Lebensmonat Videoanalysen zur Ermittlung der Qualität der Eltern-Kind-Interaktionen; rund um die ersten drei Geburtstage der Kinder jeweils Entwicklungstests, Skalen zur Einschätzung der elterlichen Versorgungskompetenz, der Erziehungseinstellung und des Anregungsgehalts im häuslichen Umfeld. Es ist vorgesehen, die Studie longitudinal weiterzuführen und Messungen bis in die SEK I vorzunehmen (ZEPPELIN 6-7; 12-13). Relevanz: ZEPPELIN ist zum einen aktuell, da frühe Förderung benachteiligter Kinder regelmässig auf der bildungs- und familienpolitischen Agenda steht. Zum anderen ist ZEPPELIN aufgrund der bestehenden Forschungslücken in der Schweiz relevant und originär, da hier zum ersten Mal ein FBBE-Programm zielgruppenspezifisch ab Geburt durchgeführt und in einer experimentellen Feldstudie evaluiert wird.

ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are small GTPases regulating membrane traffic in the secretory pathway. They are closely related and appear to have overlapping functions, regulators, and effectors. The functional specificity of individual Arfs and the extent of redundancy are still largely unknown. We addressed these questions by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletion of the human class I (Arf1/3) and class II (Arf4/5) Arfs, either individually or in combination. Most knockout cell lines were viable with slight growth defects only when lacking Arf1 or Arf4. However, Arf1+4 and Arf4+5 could not be deleted simultaneously. Class I Arfs are nonessential, and Arf4 alone is sufficient for viability. Upon Arf1 deletion, the Golgi was enlarged, and recruitment of vesicle coats decreased, confirming a major role of Arf1 in vesicle formation at the Golgi. Knockout of Arf4 caused secretion of ER-resident proteins, indicating specific defects in coatomer-dependent ER protein retrieval by KDEL receptors. The knockout cell lines will be useful tools to study other Arf-dependent processes.;"Buczak, Katarzyna; Pennauer, Mirjam; Prescianotto-Baschong, Cristina; Spiess, Martin";PXD028846;2022-01-03T00:00:00Z;http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD028846;PRIDE;Shared and specific functions of Arfs 1–5 at the Golgi revealed by systematic knockouts;BE1C6BC3-70DC-474D-BA9B-58B92C932880;182519

Predicting the repeatability of evolution remains elusive. Theory and empirical studies suggest that strong selection and large population sizes increase the probability for parallel evolution at the phenotypic and genotypic levels. However, selection and population sizes are not constant, but rather change continuously and directly affect each other even on short time scales. Here, we examine the degree of parallel evolution shaped through eco-evolutionary dynamics in an algal host population coevolving with a virus. We find high degrees of parallelism at the level of population size changes (ecology) and at the phenotypic level between replicated populations. At the genomic level, we find evidence for parallelism, as the same large genomic region was duplicated in all replicated populations, but also substantial novel sequence divergence between replicates. These patterns of genome evolution can be explained by considering population size changes as an important driver of rapid evolution.;"Becks, L; Feulner, PGD; Frickel, J; Karakoc, E";" https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4gf1qb7";2018-06-18T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org;Dryad;Data from: Population size changes and selection drive patterns of parallel evolution in a host-virus system;934A0213-AA45-4B00-BBC3-6EE22F831128;160812

Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) have been observed in epithelial ovarian tumors and have the ability to survive to antimitotic drugs. Their appearance can result from paclitaxel treatment or hypoxia, two conditions known to induce unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. PGCCs produced under hypoxia may be formed by cell fusion and can contribute by bursting and budding to the generation of cancer stem-like cells which have a more aggressive phenotype than the parental cells. Despite the fact that PGCCs may contribute to tumor maintenance and recurrence, they were poorly studied. Here, we confirmed that PGCCs could derive, at least in part, from cell fusion. We also observed that PGCCs nuclei were able to fuse. The resulting cells were able to proliferate by mitosis and were more invasive than the parental cancer cells. Using two different ovarian cancer cell lines (COV318 and SKOV3), we showed that UPR activation with chemical inducers increased cell fusion and PGCCs appearance. Down-regulation of the UPR-associated protein PERK expression partially reversed the UPR-induced PGCCs formation, suggesting that the PERK arm of the UPR is involved in ovarian PGCCs onset.;"Allard, Mathilde; Bastida-Ruiz, daniel; Cohen, marie; Dietrich, PY; Petignat, Patrick; Ribaux, Pascale; Wuillemin, Christine; Yart, Lucile";DOI;2020-01-24T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.918029;BioRIX;Linking endoplasmic reticulum stress to polyploidy in ovarian cancer cells;B31BF6FC-EAC8-43A9-88E0-FD1F7BD9EE45;163395

Its complex genome, which also included a variable shufflon region, could not be denovo assembled with long reads produced by Pacific Biosciences’ technology, but required very longreads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Importantly, a repeat analysis, whose results we release forover 9600 prokaryotes, indicated that very complex bacterial genomes represent a general phenomenonbeyond Pseudomonas. Roughly 10% of 9331 complete bacterial and a handful of 293 complete archaealgenomes represented this ‘dark matter’ for de novo genome assembly of prokaryotes. Several of these ‘dark matter’ genome assemblies contained repeats far beyond the resolution of the sequencingtechnology employed and likely contain errors, other genomes were closed employing labor-intense steps like cosmid libraries, primer walking or optical mapping.Using very long sequencing reads in combination with assembly algorithms capable of resolving long, near identical repeats will bring most prokaryotic genomes within reach of fast and complete de novo genome assembly.;"Ahrens, Christian; Schmid, Michael";CP027477-CP027481;2018-04-12T00:00:00Z;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP027481.1

Hydra possesses three distinct stem cell populations that continuously self-renew and prevent aging in Hydra vulgaris. However sexual animals from the H. oligactis cold-sensitive (Ho_CS) strain develop an aging phenotype upon gametogenesis induction, initiated by the loss of interstitial stem cells. Animals stop regenerating, lose their active behaviors and die within three months. This phenotype is not observed in the cold-resistant Ho_CR strain. To dissect the mechanisms of Hydra aging, we compared the self-renewal of epithelial stem cells in these two strains and found it irreversibly reduced in aging Ho_CS while sustained in non-aging Ho_CR. We also identified a deficient autophagy in Ho_CS epithelial cells, with a constitutive deficiency in autophagosome formation as detected with the mCherry-eGFP-LC3A/B autophagy sensor, an inefficient response to starvation as evidenced by the accumulation of the autophagosome cargo protein p62/SQSTM1, and a poorly-inducible autophagy flux upon proteasome inhibition. In the non-aging H. vulgaris animals, the blockade of autophagy by knocking-down WIPI2 suffices to induce aging. This study highlights the essential role of a dynamic autophagy flux to maintain epithelial stem cell renewal and prevent aging.;"Galliot, Brigitte; Schenkelaars, Quentin; Tomczyk, Szymon; Wenger, Yvan";Hydratlas.unige.ch;2020-01-23T00:00:00Z;https://hydratlas.unige.ch/blast/datasets/normacounts_CS2017.csv.gz;Hydratlas;Transcriptomics RNA-seq dataset from the aging cold-sensitive strain of Hydra oligactis;2C81AEEB-6665-4EFA-8969-BEB8F2E29AE7;169930

Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) is Ser/Thr protein kinase highly expressed in medulloblastoma (MB) patient samples which promotes cell migration and invasiveness downstream of growth factor receptors. Although MAP4K4 implication in the control of the membrane protrusions at the leading edge of cells during migration and invasion in MB is established, its downstream effectors governing and mediating this process in MB have not been identified. In this study we explored the proteomic neighborhood of MAP4K4 in MB cells and to identify candidate potentially affecting its activity and pro-migratory functions. Towards this aim, we expressed BioID fused versions of MAP4K4(N- and C-terminal) in HEK-293T cells under presence of biotin. In the control setup, we expressed the BioID enzyme alone. After Streptavidin purification of biotinylated proteins, we performed mass spectrometry and quantified relative abundances compared to control conditions.;Baumgartner, Martin;PXD031863;2022-08-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD031863;Pride;BioID proximity labelling of MAP4K4 interactors in HEK-293T cells;F5C2546F-C29D-4D3C-BF66-D6C06878AD6C;165860

Sphere-forming progenitor cells can be isolated from the fetal and adult mammalian inner ear and give rise to inner ear specific cell types in vitro. Here, we provide phenotypical and functional characterization of a new pool of auditory progenitors as sustainable source for sphere-derived auditory neurons. The so-called phoenix auditory neuroprogenitors, isolated from the A/J mouse spiral ganglion, exhibit nearly unlimited intrinsic self-renewal properties (beyond 40 passages). At any passage, phoenix spheres can be efficiently differentiated by withdrawing growth factors into mature spiral ganglion cells, expressing both neurons and glial cells phenotypic markers and exhibiting similar functional properties as mouse spiral ganglion explants and human sphere-derived spiral ganglion cells. The present dataset includes RNAseq-based transcriptome analysis of phoenix auditory neurons following 7 days of differentiation. mRNA levels in differentiated cells are expressed relatively to neuroprogenitor spheres of equivalent passage (paired samples at passage 12, 21 and 36);Rousset, Francis;E-MTAB-9441;2020-08-29T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-9441/;ArrayExpress;E-MTAB-9441 - RNAseq of A/J mice spiral ganglion derived neurospheres vs differentiated auditory neurons;79AC63BF-8301-40BC-8FE6-7FEAECFA15C0;170193

RNA sequencing dataTumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have immunosuppressive capacity in mouse models of cancer. Here we show that the genetic deletion of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme DICER in TAMs broadly programs them to a CD11c+MRC1−/low M1-like immunostimulatory phenotype characterized by activated interferon-γ (IFN-γ)/STAT1/IRF signaling. M1-like TAM programming fostered the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs), including tumor-antigen-specific CTLs, inhibited tumor growth, and enhanced the efficacy of PD1 checkpoint blockade. Bioinformatics analysis of TAM transcriptomes identified a limited set of miRNAs putatively involved in TAM programming. Re-expression of Let-7 in Dicer-deficient TAMs was sufficient to partly rescue the M2-like (protumoral) TAM phenotype and abate tumor CTL infiltration. Targeted suppression of DICER activity in TAMs may, therefore, stimulate antitumor immunity and enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.;De Palma, Michele;GSE76356;2016-07-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76356;NCBI GEO;DICER controls macrophage polarization and tumor response to immunotherapy;E59609BD-43BF-4AA8-BEB4-D6A610AE78A6;165963

Geobacter sulfurreducens is a widely applied microorganism for the reduction of toxic metal salts, as an electron source for bioelectrochemical devices, and as a reagent for the synthesis of nanoparticles. In order to understand the influence of metal salts, and of electron transporting, multiheme c -cytochromes on the electron flux during respiration of G. sulfurreducens , the reduction kinetic of Fe 3+ , Co 3+ , V 5+ , Cr 6+ , and Mn 7+ containing complexes were measured. Starting from the resting phase, each G. sulfurreducens cell produced an electron flux of 3.7 × 10 5 electrons per second during the respiration process. Reduction rates were within ± 30% the same for the 6 different metal salts, and reaction kinetics were of zero order. Decrease of c -cytochrome concentrations by downregulation and mutation demonstrated that c -cytochromes stabilized respiration rates by variation of their redox states. Increasing Fe 2+ /heme levels increased electron flux rates, and induced respiration flexibility. The kinetic effects parallel electrochemical results of G. sulfurreducens biofilms on electrodes, and might help to optimize bioelectrochemical devices.;"Dengjel, Jörn; Fromm, Katharina M.; Giese, Bernd; Karamash, Maksym; Salgueiro, Carlos A.; Stumpe, Michael";PRIDE;2022-06-17T00:00:00Z;http://central.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD032892;ProteomeXchange;Reduction Kinetic of Water Soluble Metal Salts by Geobacter sulfurreducens: Fe2+/Hemes Stabilize and Regulate Electron Flux Rates;5F199F8B-DF79-4DCF-A30F-7162499715D5;178827

"The purpose of the study is to compare the transcriptomic profile of the airway epithelium generated from bronchial airway epithelial cells isolated from healthy donors (NCF) and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Cells were grown at the air-liquid interface for at least 2-months. CF is caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Only patients homozygous for the F508del mutation of the CFTR gene were considered. The reconstituted airway epithelium was mechanically wounded and allowed to repair with time. We considered four steps: 1) intact, non-wounded (NW) epithelium; 2) 24h hours post-wounding (pW); 3) time at which the wound is closed (WC); 4) two days post-wound closure (pWC).

This archive contains the primary raw data and intermediate results to an extended morphometric investigations about the evolution of menardiform globorotalids (planktonic foraminifera) from ODP Hole 806C (Ontong-Java Platform) from 37 stratigraphic levels during the past 8 million years (Knappertsbusch, 2021, submitted). This study is complementary to earlier such investigations about Globorotalia menardii, G. limbata and G. multicamerata from DSDP Holes 502 and 503 and from ODP Hole 925B. The goal of these investigations is to document the tempo & mode and paleobiogeographic patterns of morphological shell evolution and speciation with special emphasis on the Neogene Globorotalia menardii - limbata - multicamerata plexus. The present archive from Hole 806C consists of another large set of digital images and structured morphometric measurements, together with the software codes to extract the data.

The purpose of the study is to compare the transcriptomic profile of the airway epithelial cell line Calu-3 in reponse to Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factor flagellin. CF is caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR gene in Calu-3 cells was knockdown by CRISPR-Cas9 (TS) and a control cell line (CTL) was aslo generated using a non-targeting guide RNA. CTL and CFTR KD Calu3-cells were grown on Transwell filters, polarized at the air-liquid interface and exposed to flagellin for 6 hours. We considered 2 non-stimulated (ND) conditions: CTL-NS and TS-NS, and 2 conditions stimulated with flagellin (Flag): CTL-Flag and TS-Flag.;Chanson, Marc;doi.org/10.26037/yareta;2020-08-24T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133495;CBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO);" 	Transcriptomic profile of Calu-3 airway epithelial cells in response to flagellin";2B738B1C-8F8C-4EE4-A05C-6A0E61BDA2D8;172909

Plants may alter their strategies, such as growth and resource acquisition, as a result of climate change, especially in areas like the Arctic. These changes might affect in turn ecosystem functions and vegetation-climate interactions. Plant traits reflect both strategies and plant trade-offs in response to environmental conditions. In combination with observational data, experiments mimicking future climate conditions and data involving multiple leaf and stem traits, can contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of feedbacks between shrub growth strategies, permafrost thaw and carbon and energy fluxes.This dataset contains both metadata and plant trait data measured in individuals of four arctic shrub species under experimental conditions. The permafrost thaw and fertilization experiment (Peng et al., 2017) ran for four years (2011-2014) in the nature reserve of Kytalyk, north-eastern Siberia (70°49'N, 147°28'E). The shrub species, dominant at the research site, were the deciduous species Betula nana ssp. exilis (Sukazcev) Hultén and Salix pulchra Cham., and the evergreen species Ledum palustre ssp. decumbens (Aiton) Hultén and Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.;Iturrate-Garcia, Maitane;10.5061/dryad.jh9w0vt8v;2020-09-01T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jh9w0vt8v;Dryad;Plant trait response of tundra shrubs to permafrost and nutrient addition;644B3F8D-430F-4E84-A0C0-D1211BABCF72;178753

"Throughout the HIV-1 replication cycle, complex host-pathogen interactions take place in the infectedcell, leading to the production of new virions. The virus modulates the host cellular machinery in orderto support its life cycle, while counteracting intracellular defense mechanisms. We investigated thedynamic host response to HIV-1 infection by systematically measuring transcriptomic, proteomic,and phosphoproteomic expression changes in infected and uninfected SupT1 CD4+ T cells at five timepoints of the viral replication process. By means of a Gaussian mixed-effects model implemented in thenew R/Bioconductor package TMixClust, we clustered host genes based on their temporal expressionpatterns. We identified a proteo-transcriptomic gene expression signature of 388 host genes specificfor HIV-1 replication. Comprehensive functional analyses of these genes confirmed the previouslydescribed roles of some of the genes and revealed novel key virus-host interactions affecting multiplemolecular processes within the host cell, including signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, andimmune system. The results of our analysis are accessible through a freely available, dedicated and userfriendly R/Shiny application, called PEACHi2.0. This resource constitutes a catalogue of dynamic hostresponses to HIV-1 infection that provides a basis for a more comprehensive understanding of virushostinteractions.https://www.omicsdi.org/dataset/pride/PXD005810; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD005810";Quadroni, Manfredo;PXD005810;2017-01-30T00:00:00Z;https://www.omicsdi.org/dataset/pride/PXD005810;ProteomeXchange database on PRIDE repository;Proteomic and phosphoproteomic data;15DC6A48-D7D3-47AA-9A2E-7092933BA35A;166412

Polarized THz time domain spectroscopy was used to study the anisotropic properties of wood-based materials for potential optical elements in the THz range, such as half-wave and quarter-wave plates. Wood samples of different species and sample thickness were studied experimentally showing high birefringence but rather high absorption. We elaborate on two approaches to optimize the optical properties for use as wave plates and assess them based on a figure of merit describing their efficiency as a function of birefringence and absorption. The first approach is to dry the wood samples, which significantly improves the efficiency of wave plates. The second approach is the use of artificially produced cellulose samples using 3D printing and freeze drying techniques, which also show birefringence caused by their similar macroscopic cellulose fibre structure. These materials have the potential as cost effective THz elements that are easy to tailor and produce for use at specific frequencies.;"Berglund, Lars A.; De Freitas Siqueira, Gilberto; Hack, Erwin; Hu, Yijie; Mavrona, Elena; Nyström, Gustav; Popov, Sergei; Rüggeberg, Markus; Zolliker, Peter";https://zenodo.org/record/7540668;2023-01-16T00:00:00Z;https://zenodo.org/record/7540668;Zenodo;Data Set to Optics Materials Express article DOI 10.1364/OME.477062;F7995243-05FD-4316-B95D-D68EDC5BE478;179061

11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism and its impaired expression and activity are associated with major diseases. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

The Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL has extensive experience with surrogate bedload transport measurements. The first measuring site was established in the Erlenbach stream, a small (first-order) catchment in the pre-alpine valley Alptal in central Switzerland. Continuous bedload transport measurements were started in 1986, using first piezoelectric sensors (1986 to 1999) and then geophone sensors (from 2002 onwards) underneath a steel plate and mounted flush with the streambed. In the meantime, the so-called Swiss plate geophone (SPG) system has been installed at more than 20 field sites, primarily in smaller and steeper streams in Switzerland, Austria, and Italy but also in a few larger rivers and in some other streams worldwide (Israel, USA, Japan). Sediment transport observations in Switzerland with the SPG system concern the following streams: Erlenbach near Brunni (Alptal valley), Albula at Tiefencastel, Navisence at Zinal, Avançon de Nant near Pont de Nant (see map). The data in this repository primarily refer to calibration measurements with the SPG system. The publications listed here discuss primarily the performance of the measuring system but also process-based aspects of bedload transport.;Rickenmann, Dieter;https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/sediment-transport-observations-in-swiss-mountain-streams;2020-07-21T00:00:00Z;https://www.envidat.ch;https://www.envidat.ch/;sediment‐transport‐observations‐in‐swiss‐mountain‐streams;A8B80926-5D9E-4D4F-A7E5-BE4177789119;172606

We present an electrophysiological dataset recorded from eleven subjects. EEG recordings are done before and after epilepsy surgery. For ECoG recordings, we used standard electrodes with 10 mm inter-contact spacing (standard ECoG) in 14 surgeries and high-density grid electrodes with 5 mm spacing (hd-ECoG) in 8 surgeries. We recorded ECoG pre- and post-resection. We detected fast ripples (FR) using a previously validated automatic detector and did visual validation. For each recording, we provided the recorded data and FR markings. We also provide the approximate locations of recordings and resected area.;"Boran, Ece; Ramantani, Georgia; Sarnthein, Johannes";https://gin.g-node.org/USZ_NCH/Scalp_EEG_HFO;2019-12-01T00:00:00Z;https://gin.g-node.org/;G-Node GIN;Dataset of pre- and postsurgical EEG recorded from epilepsy patients and HFO markings;D5E801EC-EE0F-4380-B384-BC1E7055D995;176222

"Data and R Code for the paper ""Using a goal theoretical perspective to reduce negative and promote positive spillover after a bike-to-work campaign"".Behavioral change interventions often focus on a specific behavior over a limited time period; for example, a bike-to-work intervention that incentivizes cycling to work over 2 months. While such interventions can successfully initiate behavior, they run the risk of triggering negative spillover effects after completion: Reaching the end of an intervention could reduce the motivation to maintain the behavior; or an increase in the targeted behavior (e.g., cycling to work more often) could lead to negative spillover across behaviors (e.g., cycling less in leisure time). Using a goal theoretical perspective, we tested whether an intervention focusing on a specific behavior during a limited time period (a subordinate goal) triggers negative spillover, and whether superordinate goals and/or action steps reduce negative or promote positive spillover. We conducted an experimental field study (N = 1,269) in the context of a bike-to-work campaign with a longitudinal multilevel design. Participants across all four experimental conditions had the campaign goal of cycling to work for a maximum of 2 months (a subordinate goal). A quarter of the participants additionally generated superordinate goals, a quarter action steps and a quarter superordinate goals and action steps. The last quarter was a control condition which only set the subordinate campaign goal. Surprisingly, the intervention caused no negative and some positive spillover effects. Participants increased the frequency of cycling to work across all groups and the increase could be maintained up to 2 months after the campaign. An increase in cycling to work spilled over to an increase in cycling in leisure time and to an increase in eating fruits and vegetables. No spillover effects were found regarding exercising and eating sweets and snacks. Participants focusing additionally on a superordinate goal cycled to work more frequently at the end of the campaign than the control group. Contrary to our expectations, the maintenance of cycling to work over time and the positive spillover effects across behaviors did not differ due to the goal manipulation. These results reduce the concern that interventions focusing on a subordinate goal could trigger negative spillover effects and show the need for additional experimental field studies.";Höchli, Bettina;10.17605/OSF.IO/RX9BU;2020-03-06T00:00:00Z;https://osf.io/rx9bu/?view_only=e0daaebafb5d44418891216488b3e446;Open Science Framework;Spillover from a bike-to-work campaign;01FDC9AB-8FC0-46B1-AF07-BA6F07CD6BC8;159379

Context. Directly imaged planets and substellar companions are key targets for the characterization of self-luminous atmospheres. Their photometric appearance at 4-5 μ m is sensitive to the chemical composition and cloud content of their atmosphere. Aims. We aim to systematically characterize the atmospheres of directly imaged low-mass companions at 4-5 μ m. We want to homogeneously process the data, provide robust flux measurements, and compile a photometric library at thermal wavelengths of these mostly young, low-gravity objects. In this way, we want to find trends related to their spectral type and surface gravity by comparing with isolated brown dwarfs and predictions from atmospheric models. Methods. We used the high-resolution, high-contrast capabilities of NACO at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to directly image the companions of HIP 65426, PZ Tel, and HD 206893 in the NB4.05 and/or M ′ filters. For the same targets, and additionally β Pic, we also analyzed six archival VLT/NACO datasets which were taken with the NB3.74, L ′, NB4.05, and M ′ filters. The data processing and photometric extraction of the companions was done with PynPoint while the species toolkit was used to further analyze and interpret the fluxes and colors. Results. We detect for the first time HIP 65426 b, PZ Tel B, and HD 206893 B in the NB4.05 filter, PZ Tel B and HD 206893 B in the M ′ filter, and β Pic b in the NB3.74 filter. We provide calibrated magnitudes and fluxes with a careful analysis of the error budget, both for the new and archival datasets. The L ′-NB4.05 and L ′- M ′ colors of the studied sample are all red while the NB4.05- M ′ color is blue for β Pic b, gray for PZ Tel B, and red for HIP 65426 b and HD 206893 B (although typically with low significance). The absolute NB4.05 and M ′ fluxes of our sample are all larger than those of field dwarfs with similar spectral types. Finally, the surface gravity of β Pic b has been constrained to log g = 4.17 −0.13+0.10 dex from its photometry and dynamical mass. Conclusions. A red color at 3-4 μ m and a blue color at 4-5 μ m might be (partially) caused by H 2 O and CO absorption, respectively, which are expected to be the most dominant gaseous opacities in hot ( Teff ≳ 1300 K) atmospheres. The red characteristics of β Pic b, HIP 65426 b, and HD 206893 B at 3-5 μ m, as well as their higher fluxes in NB4.05 and M ′ compared to field dwarfs, indicate that cloud densities are enhanced close to the photosphere as a result of their low surface gravity.;"Currie, T.; Daemgen, S.; Kühn, J.; Lavie, B.; Meyer, M.

Electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions are pervasive in condensed matter, governing phenomena such as transport, superconductivity, charge-density waves, polarons, and metal-insulator transitions. First-principles approaches enable accurate calculations of e-ph interactions in a wide range of solids. However, they remain an open challenge in correlated electron systems (CES), where density functional theory often fails to describe the ground state. Therefore reliable e-ph calculations remain out of reach for many transition metal oxides, high-temperature superconductors, Mott insulators, planetary materials, and multiferroics. Here we show first-principles calculations of e-ph interactions in CES, using the framework of Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+U) and its linear response extension (DFPT+U), which can describe the electronic structure and lattice dynamics of many CES. We showcase the accuracy of this approach for a prototypical Mott system, CoO, carrying out a detailed investigation of its e-ph interactions and electron spectral functions. While standard DFPT gives unphysically divergent and short-ranged e-ph interactions, DFPT+U is shown to remove the divergences and properly account for the long-range Fröhlich interaction, allowing us to model polaron effects in a Mott insulator. Our work establishes a broadly applicable and affordable approach for quantitative studies of e-ph interactions in CES, a novel theoretical tool to interpret experiments in this broad class of materials.;Zhou, Jin-Jian;https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:jt-32;2021-08-30T00:00:00Z;https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2021.141;Materials Cloud;Ab initio electron-phonon interactions in correlated electron systems;29C5191F-6163-4E23-BFC3-E15DF06AA0BB;179138

"Plakoglobin (PG; γ-Catenin, JUP) is a protein with controversial function. First described as a component of intercellular junctions, it has remained unresolved whether this near-ubiquitously expressed protein acts as a genuine transcriptional regulator in adult tissue like its closest relative β-catenin. Here we have mapped the global gene targets of PG by ChIP-chip in differentiating skin keratinocytes. Applying a peak algorithm, over 5’000 high-confidence PG target promoters were identified and 2’000 for β-catenin with an overlap of 38%.Bioinformatics analyses most significantly associated PG target genes with the Wnt signaling pathway as well as relevant pathways for keratinocyte differentiation. Using a combination of wild-type, PG, β-catenin and PG/β-catenin double null keratinocytes, PG was functionally validated as a LEF/TCF-dependent transcriptional regulator. These data challenge the current understanding of Wnt signaling, one of the most important pathways in tissue homeostasis, by identifying PG as a potent LEF/TCF-dependent transcriptional regulator which functionally overlaps with β-catenin.";Müller, Eliane J;"200037343 ";;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37343;GEO DataSets;ChIP-chip from mouse keratinocytes with Plakoglobin and β-catenin;B56DACBB-08A3-4AB9-BC6C-BAC82C818D4E;120615

The subjects were patients affected by epilepsy who underwent preoperative invasive monitoring in the mesial temporal lobe. Subjects were presented with dynamic visual sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition), interleaved with sequences of neutral landscapes (neutral condition).The dataset contains the simultaneous recording of intracranial EEG (iEEG) and neuronal spike times and waveforms, and localization information for iEEG electrodes. Subject characteristics and trial information are provided. We technically validated this dataset and provide here the spike sorting quality metrics and the spectra of iEEG signals.

Purpose: Our previous experiments showed that LPA activated inhibitory G-protein signaling in human GPR35-transfected cells. We wanted to test the LPA signaling in presence or absence of GPR35.Methods: We isolated RNA from bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from WT or GPR35-deficient mice that were treated with LPA or LPS, and left untreated for control.Results: We have found that GPR35-deficiency alters the transcriptional profiles in response to LPA in BMDMs. On the other hand, LPS-treated WT and GPR35-deficient BMDMs showed similar transcriptional changes.Conclusion: GPR35-deficientcy alters the LPA but not LPS signaling.;Kaya, Berna;GSE153012;2020-08-04T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153012;Gene Expression Omnibus;GPR35 mediates lysophosphatidic acid-signaling in bone marrow-derived macrophages at the transcriptional level;FE17EAB2-4926-4341-84E3-61B89E3C2FA4;175548

AbstractBreath analysis by secondary electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS) has potential for clinical diagnosis and drug monitoring. However, there is still a lack of benchmarking data that shows the capability of this technique and allows comparability with other breath analysis techniques. In this regard, the goal of this study was the identification of volatile compounds upon ingestion of a specific peppermint oil capsule to get benchmark data for real-time breath analysis with SESI-HRMS. This was done in the framework of a consortium set up by the International Association of Breath Research (IABR), aimed at comparing several analytical instruments for breath analysis.Breath temporal profiles of two subjects were analyzed with SESI-HRMS before and after ingestion of a peppermint oil capsule. The measurements were performed at two different locations using identical SESI-HRMS platforms to allow for comparability and benchmarking. Remarkably, along with the four major compounds (monoterpenes/cineole, menthone, menthofuran and menthol) reported by other members of the consortium, we detected 57 additional features significantly associated (ρ > 0.8) with the peppermint oil capsule, suggesting that this relatively simple intervention might trigger a more complex metabolic cascade than initially expected. This observation was made on both sites. Additional replicate experiments for one of the subjects suggested that a core of 35-40 unique molecules are consistently detected in exhaled breath upon ingestion of the capsule. In addition, we illustrate the analytical capabilities of real-time SESI-HRMS/MS to assist in the identification of unknown compounds. The results outlined herein showcase the performance of SESI-HRMS and enable comparison with other breath analysis techniques. Along with that, they strengthen the potential of this analytical technique for non-invasive drug monitoring and clinical diagnostic purposes.;"Frey, Urs; Gisler, Amanda; Lan, Jiayi; Singh, Kapil Dev; Sinues, Pablo; Usemann, Jakob; Zenobi, Renato";https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7163/ab9f8b;2020-07-16T00:00:00Z;https://www.NaN.com;NaN;Real-time breath analysis of exhaled compounds upon peppermint oil ingestion by secondary electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry: technical aspects;91232EF9-BEE4-48E8-926C-6D94831C3281;173168
"AbstractBackgroundTherapeutic management of epilepsy remains a challenge, since optimal systemic antiseizure medication (ASM) concentrations do not always correlate with improved clinical outcome and minimal side effects. We tested the feasibility of noninvasive real-time breath metabolomics as an extension of traditional therapeutic drug monitoring for patient stratification by simultaneously monitoring drug-related and drug-modulated metabolites.MethodsThis proof-of-principle observational study involved 93 breath measurements of 54 paediatric patients monitored over a period of 2.5 years, along with an adult’s cohort of 37 patients measured in two different hospitals. Exhaled breath metabolome of epileptic patients was measured in real time using secondary electrospray ionisation-high-resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS).Results We show that systemic ASM concentrations could be predicted by the breath test. Total and free valproic acid (VPA, an ASM) is predicted with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.63 and 0.66, respectively. We also find (i) high between- and within-subject heterogeneity in VPA metabolism; (ii) several amino acid metabolic pathways are significantly enriched ( p < 0.01) in patients suffering from side effects; (iii) tyrosine metabolism is significantly enriched ( p < 0.001), with downregulated pathway compounds in non-responders. ConclusionsThese results show that real-time breath analysis of epileptic patients provides reliable estimations of systemic drug concentrations along with risk estimates for drug response and side effects.";"Awchi, Mo; Datta, Alexandre N.; Frey, Urs; García-Gómez, Diego; Imbach, Lukas L.; Kohler, Malcolm; Osswald, Martin; Singh, Kapil Dev; Sinues, Pablo; Usemann, Jakob; van den Anker, Johannes; Ziesenitz, Victoria C.";https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-021-00021-3;2021-12-02T00:00:00Z;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2400/files;Metabolights;Personalised therapeutic management of epileptic patients guided by pathway-driven breath metabolomics;36337450-B621-4B58-AA89-67C0181D4201;173168
Breath analysis by secondary electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS) offers the possibility to measure comprehensive metabolic profiles. The technology is currently being deployed in several clinical settings in Switzerland and China. However, patients are required to exhale directly into the device located in a dedicated room. Consequently, clinical implementation in patients incapable of performing necessary exhalation maneuvers (e.g., infants) or immobile (e.g., too weak, elderly, or in intensive care) remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to develop a method to extend such breath analysis capabilities to this subpopulation of patients by collecting breath samples remotely (offline) and promptly (within 10 min) transfer them to SESI-HRMS for chemical analysis. We initially assessed the method in adults by comparing breath mass spectra collected offline with Nalophan bags against spectra of breath samples collected in real time. In total, 13 adults provided 176 pairs of real-time and offline measurements. Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to estimate the agreement between offline and real-time analyses. Here, 1249 mass spectral features (55% of total detected) exhibited Lin’s CCC > 0.6. Subsequently, the method was successfully deployed to analyze breath samples from infants (n = 16), obtaining as a result SESI-HRMS breath profiles. To demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the method, we measured in parallel other clinical variables: (i) lung function, which characterizes the breathing patterns, and (ii) nitric oxide, which is a surrogate marker of airway inflammation.

Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a global health concern without treatment. The challenge in finding effective therapies is due to the lack of good mouse models and the complexity of the disease, characterized by gene-environment interactions. We tested the susceptibility of seven mouse strains to develop NASH. The severity of the clinical phenotypes observed varied widely across strains. PWK/PhJ mice were the most prone to develop hepatic inflammation and the only strain to progress to NASH with extensive fibrosis, while CAST/EiJ mice were completely resistant. Levels of mitochondrial transcripts and proteins as well as mitochondrial function were robustly reduced specifically in the liver of PWK/PhJ mice, suggesting a central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH progression. Importantly, the NASH gene expression profile of PWK/PhJ mice had the highest overlap with the human NASH signature. Our study exposes the limitations of using a single mouse genetic background in metabolic studies and describes a novel NASH mouse model with features of the human NASH.;Benegiamo, Giorgia;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE201819;2023-02-09T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE201819;NCBI - GEO;The genetic background shapes the susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction and NASH progression;EE53024A-024F-4A0E-9223-6D5E234C2304;179435

Single-cell analysis of the transcriptome deepens our understanding of an individual cell's contribution to its microenvironment. Using single-cell analysis to study complex biological processes requires state-of-the-art computational tools. Assessing similarity is highly important for bioinformatics algorithms in order to determine correlations between biological information. Similarity can appear by chance, particularly for low expressed entities. This is especially relevant in single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) because the read counts obtained are lower compared to bulk RNA-sequencing and therefore classic bioinformatics tools are insufficient to obtain reproducible results. Recently, a Bayesian correlation scheme, that assigns low correlation values to correlations coming from low expressed genes, has been proposed to assess similarity for bulk RNA-seq and miRNA. This Bayesian method uses a prior distribution before using empirical evidence. Our goal was to extend the properties of this Bayesian correlation scheme to scRNA-seq data. We assessed 3 ways to compute similarity. First, we computed the similarity of each pair of genes over all cells. Second, we identified specific cell populations and computed the correlation in those specific cells. Third, we computed the similarity of each pair of genes over all clusters, by including the total mRNA expression in those cells. To study the effect of the number of cells on the method, we did not rely on simulated data, we generated 4 scRNA-seq mouse liver cell libraries with a varying number of input cells. Results: We show that Bayesian correlations are more reproducible than Pearson correlations in all the scenarios studied. Compared to Pearson correlations, Bayesian correlations have a smaller dependence on the number of input cells. We demonstrate that the Bayesian correlation algorithm assigns high similarity values to genes with a biological relevance in a specific population. Significance: Our results demonstrate that Bayesian correlation is a robust similarity measure for scRNA-seq datasets. The Bayesian method allows researchers to study similarity between pairs of genes without discarding low expressed entities and to minimize biasing the results by fake correlations. Taken together, using our method of Bayesian correlation the reproducibility of scRNA-seq experiments is increased significantly.;Sanchez-Taltavull, Danie;GSE134134;2019-12-31T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134134;GEO;Bayesian Correlation is a robust similarity measure for single cell RNA-seq data;136B4DA4-C31D-4B92-B869-BD6293E3F71C;166594

Heterochromatin is a tightly packaged form of DNA that leads to permanent or temporal gene silencing. In P. falciparum heterochromatin is formed after trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 and consequent binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Genome-wide profiling studies established that in P. falciparum blood stage schizonts heterochromatin is formed at subtelomeres and some intra-chromosomal islands. Reversible silencing of genes located in these regions has been shown to be key to, among others, antigenic variation, invasion pathway selection or commitment to gametocytogenesis. However, heterochromatic gene silencing has not been investigated in many other Plasmodium species, strains or life cycle stages, yet. Here, we used ChIP-seq to profile HP1 occupancy in asexual parasites of six different species (P. falciparum, P. knowlesi, P. vivax, P. berghei, P. yoelii, and P. chabaudi) and of four different P. falciparum strains (3D7, PF2004, NF54, NF135) as well as two different P. knowlesi clones (A1C1, A1H1). Additionally, we performed HP1 ChIP-seq on three asexual stages (ring, trophozoite and schizont stage) and two sexual stages of P. falciparum parasites. Collectively, the generated HP1 profiles provide a detailed catalog of heterochromatic genes and reveal conserved and specialized features of epigenetic control at different life cycle stages, strains and species across the genus Plasmodium.;"Bártfai, Richárd; Bozdech, Zbynek; Brancucci, Nicolas M.B.; Christensen, Peter R.; Filarsky, Michael; Fraschka, Sabine A.; Hoo, Regina; Huang, Ximei; Marti, Matthias; Mohring, Franziska; Moon, Robert W.; Mushunje, Annals T.; Niederwieser, Igor; Nosten, Francois; Preiser, Peter R.; Russell, Bruce; Voss, Till S.; Yam, Xue Yan";doi: 10.1016/j.chom.2018.01.008;2018-03-01T00:00:00Z;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102695;GEO;Comparative profiling of the heterochromatin landscape in different life cycle stages, strains and species of malaria parasites;A427D2D2-63AB-4D8A-85D0-BF36A9EC1CC0;163258

The ice core was taken in the ablation zone of the Rhone Glacier in Central Swiss Alps. The expected bedrock depth was 115-119 m from two nearby hotwater drill holes. The ice core was retrieved using a thermal drill bit, i.e. that no mechanical stress was applied to the at least -0.5°C warm temperate ice. Furthermore, this procedure allowed an oriented retrieval of the ice. The site pointing towards east was marked using a soldering iron causing small gaps in the ice segments at both ends. Due to several technical issues the drilling was stopped at 45 m and continued in a new borehole approximately 80 cm down-glacier. The second hole was drilled down to 45 m with a hotwater drilling system before continuing a successful ice coring at 50 m. At 80 m the procedure was stopped again due to larger grains of gravel found in the ice. A total of 112 ice core segments with a mean diameter of 70 mm and a mean length of 700 mm were retrieved and stored at -25°C after transporting down the glacier.;"Bauder, Andreas; Eichler, Jan; Hellmann, Sebastian; Jansen, Daniela; Kerch, Johanna; Maurer, Hansruedi; Schwikowski, Margit; Weikusat, Ilka";10.1594/PANGAEA.888518;;https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.888518;PANGAEA;Crystal c-axes measurements (Fabric Analyser G50) of ice core samples collected from the temperate Alpine ice core Rhone_2017;0B3719AC-83C7-4FE6-BA5C-6E1BBAB52FA7;169329

The three hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) 1-3 enzymes confer oxygen sensitivity to the HIF pathway and are novel therapeutic targets for treatment of renal anemia. Inhibition of the PHDs may further be beneficial in other hypoxia-associated diseases, including ischemia and chronic inflammation. Several pharmacologic PHD inhibitors (PHIs) are available, but our understanding of their selectivity and its chemical basis is limited. We here report that the PHI JNJ-42041935 (JNJ-1935) is structurally similar to the firefly luciferase substrate D-luciferin. Our results demonstrate that JNJ-1935 is a novel inhibitor of firefly luciferase enzymatic activity. In contrast, the PHIs FG-4592 (roxadustat) and FG-2216 (ICA, BIQ, IOX3, YM 311) did not affect firefly luciferase. The JNJ-1935 mode of inhibition is competitive with a Ki of 1.36 μM. D-luciferin did not inhibit the PHDs, despite its structural similarity to JNJ-1935. This study provides insights into a previously unknown JNJ-1935 off-target effect as well as into the chemical requirements for firefly luciferase and PHD inhibitors and may inform the development of novel compounds targeting these enzymes.;Scholz, Carsten;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.905qfttjd;2020-10-28T00:00:00Z;https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.905qfttjd;Dryad;Inhibition of firefly luciferase activity by a HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor;0CA03186-FA64-4E72-AE85-DCF5E08EA166;184813

The data herein presents a new chironomid record and associated chironomid-based temperature reconstruction covering the mid Eemian to the end of the first Würmian stadial (ca. 125-105 ka), augmented by results for the late Rissian glaciation and the early Brörup interstadial from the Füramoos palaeolake, southern Germany. There is an unconformity in the sediment core analysed between the late Rissian sediments and the mid Eemian sediments. These data also include non-chironomid invertebrate remains, including Ceratopogonidae, Daphnia and Ephemeroptera as well as Characean oospores.;"Bolland, Alexander; Kern, Oliver A.; Koutsodendris, Andreas; Pross, Jörg";https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8cz8w9gpt;2021-12-07T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8cz8w9gpt;Dryad;Chironomid assemblages and inferred summer temperature, late Rissian, Eemian and earliest Würmian, S Germany;01AF9468-7171-444B-8978-DF9B225C7565;165494

Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) generate new neurons throughout adulthood. However, the underlying regulatory processes are still not fully understood. Lipid metabolism plays an important role in regulating NSPC activity: build-up of lipids is crucial for NSPC proliferation, whereas break-down of lipids has been shown to regulate NSPC quiescence. Despite their central role for cellular lipid metabolism, the role of lipid droplets (LDs), the lipid storing organelles, in NSPCs remains underexplored. Here we show that LDs are highly abundant in adult mouse NSPCs, and that LD accumulation is significantly altered upon fate changes such as quiescence and differentiation. NSPC proliferation is influenced by the number of LDs, inhibition of LD build-up, breakdown or usage, and the asymmetric inheritance of LDs during mitosis. Furthermore, high LD-containing NSPCs have increased metabolic activity and capacity, but do not suffer from increased oxidative damage. Together, these data indicate an instructive role for LDs in driving NSPC behaviour.;"Knobloch, Marlen; Madsen, Sofia; Maillard, Vanille; Ramosaj, Mergim; Scandella, Valentina; Sudria-Lopez, Daniel; Telley, Ludovic; Yuizumi, Naoya";GSE187470;;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE187470;GEO Gene expression Omnibus;Lipid droplet availability affects neural stem/progenitor cell metabolism and proliferation;CB2EF2B9-B1EC-446A-98B0-6EFB553602A7;175570

FORS won the open tender by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports to conduct the 2016-17 Swiss Federal Surveys of Adolescents (ch-x), which focuses on the topic of the geographical mobility of young people. ch-x are long-established large-scale surveys conducted amongst 19 to 21-year-old Swiss citizens. They provide virtually full coverage of young men drafted into the army, as well as a sample of women of the same age.The 2016-17 edition will allow an entire cohort of young men over a two-year period to be examined, as well as a complementary sample of approximately 2,000 women of the same age. Never before has there been a large-scale survey of this nature on the topic of mobility, with a special focus on language, professional and cultural stays in other language areas of Switzerland and abroad. The comprehensiveness of the paper questionnaire (over 100 questions) as well as the number of respondents in the dataset (more than 40,000) result in extremely rich data that will enable significant contributions in the fields of mobility and youth studies.;"Ferrez, Eliane; Heers, Marieke; Kleiner, Brian; Stam, Alexandra; van den Hende, Anthe";10.23662/FORS-DS-1107-1;2020-07-20T00:00:00Z;https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/16843/0/;FORS BASE;Life course and experiences of mobility (ch-x 2016/2017);3F6E5379-0213-40D5-AD4F-D4A14E0A5004;165726

The internal structure of the extant larger benthic foraminifer Borelis schlumbergeri Reichel (1937) (Alveolinidae Ehrenberg, 1839) was investigated by high resolution hard x-ray computer tomography. Scanning was carried out using a single specimen using a Phoenix nanotom m from GE Sensing & Inspection Technologies GmbH. Exposure to hard x-rays was during about 4 hours and 1440 equiangular radiographs were taken along 360°. From the 2108 virtual slices through the stack visualizations of internal microstructures of the calcareous test and sarcode reconstruction were generated after segmentation and rendering in AVIZO7 software from FEI Visualization Sciences Group and using Voxler2 software from Golden Software, LLC. The 2.6 GB set including raw images, derived stacks of AVIZO labels, and video representations illustrating the interior of the Borelis specimen is put on line in form of a zipped archive for further experimentation by the community and for usage in micropaleontological training classes. The archive comprises the original stack of dicom images generated by the nanotom device, a reduced stack of derived AVIZO7 files and labels illustrating the reconstructed inner structures and rendered surfaces, a second reduced data stack of dicom images for loading and experimentation with ImageJ and Voxler2 software, an Excel-sheet containing volume measurements of individual segmented chambers and chamberlets.In addition, several videos (GIF, AVI, MPEG) are provided illustrating the growth of the sarcode body from embryonic stage to adult stage, and showing the shell architecture of the investigated Borelis specimen in animated series of vertical slices.Using the presented data requires access to AVIZO7 and / or Voxler2, which are commercial software. Alternatively, the provided stack of dicom images can also loaded and analyzed using open source Java plugins to ImageJ, which is in the public domain (https://imagej.net/). For visualization image stacks three-dimensionally and for volume rendering the ImageJ 3D Viewer plugin can be applied (http://3dviewer.neurofly.de), and segmentation of inner structures can be done using the Segmentation Editor in ImageJ from Johannes Schindelin, Francois Kusztos and Benjamin Schmid (https://imagej.net/Segmentation_Editor).;"Costeur, Loic; Kellner, Siri; Knappertsbusch, Michael; Müller, Bert; Schulz, Georg";https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.884663;2018-02-10T00:00:00Z;https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.884663;PANGAEA;"Data-archive to ""Imaging the internal structure of Borelis schlumbergeri Reichel (1937): Advances by high-resolution hard X-ray tomography"".";67C43563-9785-4D25-B5C4-6C3A1B3C0F75;169048

"Background: Life-skills trainings conducted within the school curriculum are effective in preventing the onset and escalation of substance use among adolescents. However, their dissemination is impeded due to their large resource requirements. Life-skills training provided via mobile phones might represent a more economic and scalable approach. The main objective of the planned study is to test the efficacy of a mobile phone-based life-skills training to prevent substance use among adolescents within a controlled trial.ResultsResults after completion of 6-months follow upThe intervention program showed a high acceptance in the target group of secondary school students with 94.7% of intervention group participants who remained signed in until the end of the six-month program. Primary outcomes of the study were 30-days prevalence of (1) problem drinking and (2) tobacco smoking. Based on intention to treat analyses, the program showed a significant preventive intervention effect in terms of problem drinking (p=.03) with a lower increase from baseline to follow-up in the intervention group (+1.9%) than in the control group (+2.8%). Tobacco smoking prevalence increased by +0.7% in the intervention group and +2.3% in the control group (p=.22). Regarding secondary outcomes, a significant intervention effect was found for cigarettes smoked per month (CPM) (p=.004) with a mean reduction of -2.4 CPM in the intervention group and an increase of +5.1 CPM in controls. Further intervention effects were observed for frequency of cannabis use (p=.04) with a steeper increase of cannabis use frequency in controls. The results were published in JMIR Mhealth & Uhealth 2021 (doi.org/10.2196/26951).Longer-term results based on 18-months follow upCompared to controls, those in the intervention group experienced reduced tobacco-smoking prevalence (OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.49-0.99), but no significant reduction in problem-drinking (OR=0.85, 0.60-1.17). Among secondary outcomes, the intervention was effective at reducing cannabis-smoking prevalence (OR=0.57, 95% CI=0.41;0.78) and cannabis use days (Cohen’s d=-0.19, 95% CI=-0.29;-0.09), while no effects were observed for quantity of alcohol use, quantity of cigarettes smoked, well-being, or social skills.Gender moderated the effect on problem drinking prevalence, with intervention-group females exhibiting increased odds of problem drinking than female controls (OR=1.64, 0.96-2.78) and an immigrant background moderating the effect on tobacco-smoking prevalence, with a greater interventional effect observed among immigrants (OR=0.59, 0.34-1.06). The results are currently under review AJPM (current date: 11.04.22).";Haug, Severin;https://doi.org/10.48573/g6hb-qc82;2022-04-14T00:00:00Z;https://www.swissubase.ch/en/catalogue/studies/14001/latest/datasets/2083/2278/overview;SwissUBase;Efficacy of a mobile phone-based life-skills training for substance use prevention among adolescents;B792C5AE-77A6-43DD-AA2B-6938A64BA501;179222

The database provided here forms the basis of a study which is published in the journal World Development (year 2020) under the title ' Vietnam’s forest cover changes 2005-2016: veering from transition to (yet more) transaction?'. The database contains two hundred province-level data variables provided by government agencies. The database includes potentially relevant indicators of the Vietnamese provinces’ terrain and geography (G variables), forestland and tree plantation cover/changes (F), population density/changes and ethnic composition (P), labor and poverty (L), development of infrastructure (S) and hydro-electric capacities (H), agricultural cultivations/changes and productivity (A), industrial wood processing capacities (W), illicit logging (C), forestland tenure/contracts (T), payments for forest ecosystem service (PFES) funding/coverage (E), as well as various indices of governance, institutional and public administration, and socio-economic performance (I). Each variable contains 63 data (i.e. 63 Vietnamese provinces) and is described in detail in the file, including data type and summary statistics. The variables were mostly accessible directly from government sources, or indirectly from NGOs or via international publications (the sources are indicated in the file).;"Cochard, Roland; Kull, Christian; Ngo, Tri Dung; Nguyen, Thi Hai Van";10.5281/zenodo.3903596;2020-06-22T00:00:00Z;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3903596;Zenodo;Database for study on Vietnam's forest cover changes 2005-2016;90CFC42E-92B1-4076-9286-0D1EFEE2D80B;194004
