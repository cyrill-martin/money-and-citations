# Statistical Data Analysis and Data Visualization
This repository contains the files of my projects completed as part of the Certificate of Advanced Studies in Statistical Data Analysis & Data Visualization at the Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences.

All data analysis files are located in the "data" directory. Similarly, all files for the visualization project are located in the "docs" directory to ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages.
